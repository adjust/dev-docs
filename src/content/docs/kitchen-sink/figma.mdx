Adjust uses [Figma](https://figma.com) to design diagrams and mockups to use in documentation. Rather than exporting these designs as images, it makes sense to embed the Figma designs directly to ensure that the documentation contains the most up-to-date version. Figma files can be embedded as iframes using the `<FigmaEmbed>` component.

<Table>

| Prop       | Data type | Required | Description                                 |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `embedUrl` | String    | Yes      | The URL of the file that you want to embed. |

</Table>

## Examples

A standard figma embed requires only an `embedUrl`.

```mdx /embedUrl=\"(.*)\"/
<FigmaEmbed embedUrl="https://www.figma.com/file/OPHIkF4vIIn0EsV1RcZ92c/Test?type=design&node-id=5-42" />
```

<FigmaEmbed embedUrl="https://www.figma.com/file/OPHIkF4vIIn0EsV1RcZ92c/Test?type=design&node-id=5-42" />

### Custom caption

You can add a caption by enclosing content inside the `<FigmaEmbed></FigmaEmbed>` tags.

```mdx "This is a caption"
<FigmaEmbed embedUrl="https://www.figma.com/file/OPHIkF4vIIn0EsV1RcZ92c/Test?type=design&node-id=5-42">
   This is a caption
</FigmaEmbed>
```

<FigmaEmbed embedUrl="https://www.figma.com/file/OPHIkF4vIIn0EsV1RcZ92c/Test?type=design&node-id=5-42">
   This is a caption
</FigmaEmbed>
