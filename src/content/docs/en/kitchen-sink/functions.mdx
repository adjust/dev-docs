Function components help to standardize the presentation of SDK functions.

## Function syntax

Functions are split up into several parts:

1. The `Function` invocation containing the props.
2. A description (rendered in the `default` slot).
3. A named slot called `signature` that contains the method signature.
4. A named slot called `snippet` that contains the code example.
5. An optional named slot called `parameters` that contains information about parameters.
6. An optional named slot called `returns` that contains information about return values.

Slots may contain any markdown information. It's best practice to define all parameters and return values using [definition list syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#definition-lists).

## appTrackingAuthorizationStatus

As of iOS 14.5, users need to give explicit consent for you to capture a device's <Abbr>IDFA (ID for Advertisers)</Abbr>. You can query the Adjust SDK for the consent status with the `appTrackingAuthorizationStatus` method.

<slot slot="signature">

```objc
+ (int)appTrackingAuthorizationStatus;
```

</slot>

<slot slot="snippet">

```swift
let authorizationStatus = Adjust.appTrackingAuthorizationStatus()
```

</slot>

<slot slot="parameters">

`status` (integer)
: The status code detailing whether the user has authorized tracking on their device.

</slot>

<slot slot="returns">

`appTrackingAuthorizationStatus` (integer)
: The user's authorization status.

| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`   | The user hasn't yet been asked to authorize tracking. |
| `1`   | The user's device is restricted.                      |
| `2`   | The user has denied access to the IDFA.               |
| `3`   | The user has authorized access to the IDFA.           |
| `-1`  | The status isn't available.                           |
