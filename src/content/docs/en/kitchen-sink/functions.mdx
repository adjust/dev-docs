Function components help to standardize the presentation of SDK functions.

| Prop   | Data type | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `lang` | String    | Yes      | The language the function is written in (example: `java`).                                                                                                                            |

| `link` | URL       | Yes      | The [GitHub permalink](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet) of the method signature |

## Function syntax

Functions are split up into several parts:

1. The `Function` invocation containing the props.
2. A description (rendered in the `default` slot).
3. A named slot called `snippet` that contains the code example.
4. An optional named slot called `parameters` that contains information about parameters.
5. An optional named slot called `returns` that contains information about return values.

Slots may contain any markdown information. It's best practice to define all parameters and return values using [definition list syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#definition-lists).

As of iOS 14.5, users need to give explicit consent for you to capture a device's ID for Advertisers (IDFA). You can query the Adjust SDK for the consent status with the `appTrackingAuthorizationStatus` method.

<slot slot="snippet">

```swift
let authorizationStatus = Adjust.appTrackingAuthorizationStatus()
```

</slot>

<slot slot="parameters">

`status` (integer)
: The status code detailing whether the user has authorized tracking on their device.

</slot>

<slot slot="returns">

`appTrackingAuthorizationStatus` (integer)
: The user's authorization status.
