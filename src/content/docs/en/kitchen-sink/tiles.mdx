Tiles are components that help to visually compartmentalize content. Tiles render to [ATLAS Tiles](https://atlas.adeven.com/docs/components/Tile).

## Props

## Examples

Tiles can be customized with a title and an `icon`. These are optional and may be left out. The first `<h3>` element (`###`) is taken as the title.

`Tile` components can contain only **Markdown** and [inline typography](/en/kitchen-sink/typography). Structural components such as `Callout` and `Accordion` elements won't render in a Tile.
