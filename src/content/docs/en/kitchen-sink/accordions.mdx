Accordions are components which visually hide additional information to make a page less busy. Accordions implement the ATLAS [Accordion component](https://atlas.adeven.com/docs/components/Accordion).

## Examples

### Standard Accordion

Accordions should have a title. The first `<h3>` element (`###`) is taken as the title.

```mdx "### Example accordion"
