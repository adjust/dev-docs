Accordions are components which visually hide additional information to make a page less busy. Accordions implement the ATLAS [Accordion component](https://atlas.adeven.com/docs/components/Accordion).

Accordions should have a title. This is defined in the `title` prop.

</Accordion>
```

### Accordion with badge

Optionally, a badge can be added to the side of the accordion by passing a label to the `badge` prop.

```mdx 'title="Example accordion"' 'badge="iOS"'
<Accordion title="Example accordion" badge="iOS">
