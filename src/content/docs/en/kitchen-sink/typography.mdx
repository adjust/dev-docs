This page contains reference material for the developer hub's custom inline markup.

## Icons

Icons should be used to visually clarify information, or to show how an interface item (such as a button) appears in the frontend.

<Table>

| Prop|  Data type| Required| Description|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name`|  String| Yes| The name of the icon you want to render. See [the list of icons in ATLAS](https://atlas.adeven.com/docs/components/Icon#available-icons)|

</Table>

### Example

```mdx "<Icon name=\"Copy\" />"
Select the copy button (<Icon name="Copy" />).
```

Select the copy button (<Icon name="Copy" />).

## Badges

Badges are used to visually highlight inline content.

<Table>

| Prop |  Data type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `color` |  String | No. Defaults to `info` | The color of the badge. `info` \| `note` \| `tip` \| `warning` \| `important` |
| `icon` |  String | No | The name of the icon you want to render. See [the list of icons in ATLAS](https://atlas.adeven.com/docs/components/Icon#available-icons) |

</Table>

### Example

Badges are `neutral` by default and contain no icon.

```mdx
<Badge>This is a badge</Badge>
```

<Badge>This is a badge</Badge>

Badges can be styled the same way as [Callouts](/en/kitchen-sink/callouts) by passing a `color` prop.

```mdx
<Badge color="important">An important badge</Badge>
```

<Badge color="important">An important badge</Badge>

You can pass an ATLAS icon to the badge to add visual clarity.

```mdx
<Badge color="warning" icon="Warning">Warning with icon</Badge>
```

<Badge color="warning" icon="Warning">Warning with icon</Badge>

## Interface labels

Interface labels are used to denote that text refers to a label in the interface of the tool in question. 

<Callout type="note">

Items in `GuiLabel` tags are exempt from style guide checks.

</Callout>

```mdx
Select <GuiLabel>My Account</GuiLabel>
```

Select <GuiLabel>My Account</GuiLabel>

## Menu Selections

Menu Selections are used to denote that text refers to a sequence of menu items in the tool in question. The component transforms `-->` notation into `â€£` notation for visual clarity.

<Callout type="note">

Items in `MenuSelection` tags are exempt from style guide checks.

</Callout>

```mdx
Select <MenuSelection>File --> My Profile --> Billing</MenuSelection>
```

Select <MenuSelection>File --> My Profile --> Billing</MenuSelection>

## Abbreviations

Abbreviations can be written using the `<Abbr>` component. This component transforms content written as `${Abbreviation} (${expanded version})` into native HTML [`<abbr>` tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr).

```mdx
<Abbr>RTBF (Right to be forgotten)</Abbr>
```

<Abbr>RTBF (Right to be forgotten)</Abbr>
