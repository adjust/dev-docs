Use the `/status` endpoint to check the status of your new app. This endpoint returns the status of the process that copies settings from your `_Template` app to your new app.

## Endpoint

```http "/status" "/{ticket_token}"
GET https://settings.adjust.com/api/status/{ticket_token}
```

### GET request
