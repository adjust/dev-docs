With Adjust's S2S Security feature, you can guarantee the security of your S2S events and protect against spoofed requests. Each S2S authentication incoming request must carry a token generated in your Adjust dashboard. Requests that don't carry a valid token are rejected by Adjust's servers.

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

Here's what you need to know before getting started.

<Callout type="warning">

S2S Security isn't compatible with Google Tag Manager event measurement. Using Adjust's S2S authentication tokens in your Google Tag Manager configuration means that incoming Google Tag events are rejected.

</Callout>

### Requirements {#requirements}

- [Admin permissions](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/permission-levels)

## Create an S2S token {#create-an-s2s-token}

You must configure at least one token and specify its **scope**. Scopes define what actions you can take using a token. The following scopes are available:

- **Events**: grants the ability to send event data.
- **Sessions**: grants the ability to send session data.
- **Ad revenue**: grants the ability to send ad revenue data.
- **GDPR**: grants the ability to authenticate the GDPR endpoint. The GDPR scope isn't available at token creation, but you can set it up in the [Enable S2S authentication](#enable-s2s-authentication) section.

To create a new scoped token:

1. Under **AppView**, select **All apps**.
2. Select your app.
3. Select the **Protection** tab.
4. Under the **S2S Security** section, select **Open S2S Security**.

5. Select **+ New token**. A modal appears.
6. In the modal that appears, enter a token **Token name**.

7. Select the scope or scopes you want to assign to the token from the **Scope** dropdown. You can select multiple scopes for each token.

   ![A token modal with scopes selected](@images/s2s/3-token-scope-modal.png)

8. Select **Add token** to save your token.
9. Select **Copy token and close** to copy the token. Send it to your developer to add to your S2S event requests.

   ![A modal with a "Copy token and close" option](@images/s2s/4-copy-token.png)

The scopes of each token are visible in the token list.

The **Enable S2S authentication** toggle is **OFF** by default. Follow the instructions in the next section to enable S2S authentication.

## Enable S2S authentication {#enable-s2s-authentication}

<Callout type="important">

Activate S2S authentication only after your developer has tested token implementation, and your Technical Account Manager or support@adjust.com has validated your setup.

</Callout>

After adding your scoped tokens, you need to enable S2S authentication for the selected scope endpoints. To enable S2S authentication, follow these steps:

1. Under **AppView**, select **All apps**.
2. Select your app.
3. Select the **Protection** tab.
4. Under the **S2S Security** section, select **Open S2S Security**.
5. Ensure you have at least one scoped token configured.
6. Switch the **Enable S2S authentication** toggle **ON**.
7. (Optional) You may also customize the authentication scopes by selecting the endpoint or endpoints to authenticate.

   ![An authentication scopes modal with scopes selected](@images/s2s/7-select-authentication-scopes.png)

8. Select **Apply**.

You can modify authentication scopes at any time by selecting **Customize scopes**.

## Modify a scoped token {#modify-a-scoped-token}

To modify the scopes of an existing token:

1. Under **AppView**, select **All apps**.
2. Select your app.
3. Select the **Protection** tab.
4. Under the **S2S Security** section, select **Open S2S Security**.
5. Find your token in the list and select the edit icon.
6. Add or remove scopes from the **Scope** dropdown.
7. Select **Edit token** to save your changes.

   ![A modal showing a token with a list of scopes](@images/s2s/6-scoped-token-edit.png)

Now, all incoming S2S requests are required to carry an active authentication token. If you previously configured a token without any scopes, these will continue to work for **all** endpoints. For added security, you should use scoped tokens.

## Example authenticated request {#example-authenticated-request}

```console
curl -v -X \
POST -H \
"Authorization: Bearer v8s5opi0zs45607l8h8c48wak2vxb5oe" \

```

Requests return one of the responses below.

| Response code | Response message             | Reason                                                                                       |

| `202`         | Wrong authentication token   | Token added but not recognized.<br />Check it's set correctly and is active on the dashboard |
| `401`         | Session failed               | The request had insufficient authentication scopes                                           |

## Manage your tokens {#manage-your-tokens}

To add multiple auth tokens, follow the same [setup steps listed above](#activate-s2s-authentication).

<Callout type="note">

Always test your tokens after implementation. When S2S authentication is active, requests with new tokens that aren't correctly implemented are rejected.

</Callout>

If you're no longer using a token, you can **deactivate** it:

1. Under **AppView**, select **My apps**.
2. Select your app.
3. Select the **Protection** tab.
4. Under the **S2S Security** section, select **Open S2S Security**.
5. Find your token and slide the toggle to the **off** position.

<Callout type="important">

If you deactivate all your tokens, Adjust automatically deactivates S2S authentication to ensure you don't reject all S2S traffic.

</Callout>

You can reactivate inactive tokens at any time sliding the toggle to the **on** position, or hide inactive tokens by turning the **Show inactive tokens** toggle off.

To deactivate S2S authentication, disable the toggle labeled **S2S authentication is ON: youâ€™re protected against fraud.**. A warning modal appears. Select **Turn off** to deactivate S2S authentication.
