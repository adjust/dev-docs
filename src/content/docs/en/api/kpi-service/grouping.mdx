The KPI service gives you grouping options to enable you to format your data how you want. You can pass several grouping options in each call.

The KPI service groups results based on the order in which you pass grouping options. If you pass the following, the KPI service groups results by tracker and nests results for each country.

```text "trackers" "countries"
grouping=trackers,countries
```

If you pass the following, the KPI service groups results by country and nests results for each tracker.
