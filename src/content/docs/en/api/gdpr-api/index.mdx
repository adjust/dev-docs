Adjust offers an API endpoint to facilitate RTBF (Right to be Forgotten) requests. This endpoint performs the following actions for a given device:

-  Permanently deletes all the user’s personal data from Adjust for the specified app.
-  Stops receiving the user’s information from the Adjust SDK for the specified app.
-  Removes all references to the user's data in the Adjust dashboard for the specified app.
-  Configure your server to send requests to this API endpoint when users send RTBF requests. See Adjust's [GDPR article](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/gdpr) for more information about RTBF requests.

<Callout type="important">

This action is permanent. Adjust can't reinstate data previously associated with a device or receive future requests from the device once a RTBF request is sent.

</Callout>
