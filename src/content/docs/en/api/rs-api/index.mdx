The Report Service API enables you to query Adjust's reporting dataset to retrieve aggregated data. Use these endpoints to filter, sort, and retrieve your Adjust data with ease.

## 1. Authenticate your calls

To use the Report Service API endpoints, you first need to get your Adjust API token. Follow the instructions in the [Authentication article](/en/api/rs-api/authentication) to find out how to use this token with the API.

## 2. Find your metrics

Adjust supports a lot of metrics that you can use to filter your reports. Many of these metrics exist on a per-app or per-event basis.

A full list of metrics is available in the [Datascape metrics glossary](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/datascape-metrics-glossary). You can also use the Filters Data endpoint to search for KPIs. You can also use the Events endpoint to return the machine-generated slugs of your events for use in CSV reports.

## 3. Choose your response format

The Report Service API contains endpoints for three different report formats. Choose the endpoint that matches the format you want to receive:

-  Reports endpoint: returns data as JSON.
-  CSV reports endpoint: returns data as CSV.
-  Pivot reports endpoint: returns data as JSON with a field that breaks down totals by dimension.
