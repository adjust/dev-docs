Use the device API to view device information and clear device history from Adjust for testing purposes.

## How it works

1. Authenticate your calls

   To use the Device API endpoints, you first need to get your Adjust API token. Follow the instructions in the [Authentication article](authentication.mdx) to find out how to use this token with the API.

2. Inspect device details

   Use the [inspect device endpoint](inspect.mdx) to return details about a device and associated user activity.

3. Forget a device

   Use the [forget device endpoint](forget.mdx) to clear device history from Adjust. This is useful if you need to clear device data to test multiple installs on the same device.
