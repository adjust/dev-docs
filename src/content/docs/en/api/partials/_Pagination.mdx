### Pagination

Results from this endpoint are paginated using a cursor. Each page returns the location of the previous and next pages. You can include these in your calls to return specific pages. You can also limit the number of items included on a page. The default limit is `50`.

Each results page contains a "paging" object containing the cursor positions. You can use these cursor positions to programatically move between pages. For example, the first page might contain results like this:

```json
"paging": {
   "page_size": "50",
   "collection_size": "49",
   "total": "199",
   "cursors": {
      "after": "g2wAAAACYhW1_gxkAANuaWxq",
      "before": null
   },
   "next": "https://api.adjust.com/public/v1/apps/yxs12pfewq/trackers?after=g2wAAAACYhW1_gxkAANuaWxq&limit=50",
   "previous": null
}
```

To go to the second page, add the after value to the next request in the after parameter. For example:

```console
$ curl "https://api.adjust.com/public/v1/apps/yxs12pfewq/trackers?after=g2wAAAACYhW1_gxkAANuaWxq"
```
