## Find your Adjust API token

Before you can start making API calls, you first need to find your Adjust API token. You can find your Adjust API token in your Adjust dashboard.

If you've configured SSO, your API tokens aren't available in the Adjust dashboard. Reach out to your Adjust representative or support@adjust.com for help with API tokens.

Your Adjust API token is located in your **profile**. To find it, follow these steps:

1. Select the settings icon (<Icon name="CogWheel" />) in the bottom left corner.
2. Select <GuiLabel>Account settings</GuiLabel>. Your account settings page opens.
3. Select the <GuiLabel>My profile</GuiLabel> tab.
4. Your <GuiLabel>API Token</GuiLabel> is shown with your <GuiLabel>User Details</GuiLabel>. Select the copy button (<Icon name="Copy" />) to copy the token to your system clipboard.

## Reset your Adjust API token

You can reset your Adjust API token at any time. Resetting your token invalidates the old token. This means that any requests made using the old token won't work. If you reset your Adjust API token, you need to make sure to update it wherever it's in use.

1. Select the settings icon (<Icon name="CogWheel" />) in the bottom left corner.
2. Select <GuiLabel>Account settings</GuiLabel>. Your account settings page opens.
3. Select the <GuiLabel>My Profile</GuiLabel> tab.
4. Your <GuiLabel>API Token</GuiLabel> is shown with your <GuiLabel>User details</GuiLabel>.
5. Select <GuiLabel>Reset API token</GuiLabel>. A popup modal appears.
6. Enter your account password in the modal and select <GuiLabel>Reset</GuiLabel> to reset your API token. The modal closes and a confirmation appears in the top right of the screen.
7. Select the copy button (<Icon name="Copy" />) next to the <GuiLabel>API Token</GuiLabel> to copy the token to your system clipboard.
