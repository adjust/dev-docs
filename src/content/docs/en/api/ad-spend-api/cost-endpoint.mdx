Adjust's Ad Spend API provides accurate, transparent, and granular ad spend data. Adjust maps the cost information using a campaign's `cost_id` allowing Report Services to report the ad spend data back to the partner.

## Before you begin

To integrate with the Adjust ad spend API you must set up your servers to send a set of mandatory parameters to Adjust through an HTTP POST request to the designated endpoint.

<Callout type="note">

Adjust accepts ad spend data for an engagement up to seven days after it happens. You can send data at any time during this window.

</Callout>

## Endpoint

```http title="Endpoint" "/cost"
POST https://app.adjust.com/cost
```

### POST request

The POST method sends the cost information of a campaign using the `cost_id`.

<Callout type="important">

The Ad Spend API can't process capital letters. Make sure to input all parameters in lowercase.
