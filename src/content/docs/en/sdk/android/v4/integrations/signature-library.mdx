<Callout type="note">

This page refers to integration steps for the Adjust SDK v4. If you're using the Adjust SDK v5, please select the appropriate tab on the dropdown menu to your left.

</Callout>

Adjust's SDK Signature library is designed to be a standalone plugin for the Adjust SDK. This means you don’t need to change any of your code or change how you use the Adjust SDK in your app. Once you install the plugin, all requests made by the Adjust SDK will continue to work as expected.

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

<Callout type="note">

The Signature library is configured to use [16KB page sizes](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes) in [version 3.32.0 or greater](https://github.com/adjust/adjust_signature_sdk/releases/tag/v3.32.0).

</Callout>

To integrate the Signature library into your Android app, ensure the following:

- The Android API version in use is **21 or greater**.
- The Adjust SDK version in use is **4.38.2 or greater**. This requirement applies even when the Adjust SDK is used indirectly.
- If you use Proguard, you must use the exact same Proguard configuration for both the Signature library and the Adjust SDK.

<Callout type="important">

Using external obfuscation tools with the Adjust SDK or Signature library can impact the functionality of the Signature library. If you're unsure about using an external tool, reach out to your Adjust representative or email support@adjust.com to check if functionality is impacted.

</Callout>

### Migrating from Signature v1 or v2 library {#migrating-from-signature-v1-or-v2-library}

If you previously used Signature v1 or Signature v2, you first need to remove the previous version before integrating the Signature library. To do this:

- If you previously integrated Signature v1, remove any code that calls to signature functions in your project.
- If you previously integrated Signature v2, remove the Signature v2 library from your project.

## Integrate the Signature library {#integrate-the-signature-library}

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Maven" sync="maven">

The Signature libraries are released on [GitHub](https://github.com/adjust/adjust_signature_sdk/releases/) and are propagated to Maven from version `3.20.1` onwards. To add the Signature library to your project, append the following to your app-level `build.gradle` (change the version with the [latest available](https://github.com/adjust/adjust_signature_sdk/releases/latest)):

```groovy
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.adjust.signature:adjust-android-signature:x.x.x'
}
```

Alternatively, the Beta releases are available on Maven from version `3.24.1` onwards. To add the Signature library to your project, append the following to your project-level and app-level `build.gradle` respectively (change the version with the [latest available](https://github.com/adjust/adjust_signature_sdk/releases)):

```groovy
repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"
        }
...
```

```groovy
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.adjust.signature:adjust-android-signature:x.x.x-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

That’s it! The Signature library is now integrated into your project. Follow the steps in the next section to configure your digital certificates in the Adjust suite.

4. Open your app-level `build.gradle` file and add the following:

   ```groovy
   android {
      defaultConfig {
         ndk.abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a','arm64-v8a','x86','x86_64'
      }
   }

   dependencies {
      implementation files('libs/adjust-lib.aar')
   }
   ```

5. Select **Sync Now** in the Android Studio popup to synchronize your changes.

That’s it! The Signature library is now integrated into your project. Follow the steps in the next section to configure your digital certificates in the Adjust suite.

## Set up your certificates in the Adjust suite {#set-up-your-certificates-in-the-adjust-suite}

Once you integrate the Signature library into your app, all requests sent by the Adjust SDK to Adjust are signed. The Adjust SDK will also transmit relevant information to Adjust’s servers, including the fingerprint of your signing certificate.

A certificate fingerprint is a cryptographic hash of the public information held within a certificate. It can be used to verify the authenticity of an app.

The Signature library can’t verify the authenticity of your certificate fingerprints. The fingerprints need to be added to an allowlist in the Adjust Suite in order for requests containing them to be accepted by Adjust as authentic. To do this, you need to retrieve the certificate fingerprints and send them to Adjust.

<Callout type="important">

You must add the fingerprints of your signing certificates to the allowlist. If no fingerprints are added to the allowlist, traffic from your app can be spoofed.

</Callout>

#### From a keystore {#from-a-keystore}

If you use your own keystore, or if Android Studio generated a keystore for you, you can retrieve the certificate fingerprint by following these steps:

1. Find the keystore file (`.jks`) you used to sign **the release version of your app**. The keystore must be the one you used to sign the release version sent to the Google Play Store. If the keystore is different, your SDK requests will be rejected.
2. Run the following command to list your keys. Replace the parts in angle brackets with your information.

   ```console
   $ keytool -list -v -keystore <path/to/keystore.jks> -alias <your_key_alias>
   ```

   This command prompts you for your keystore password. This is the password you defined when you generated the keystore.

   The final output looks like this:

   ```text
   Alias name: Key0
   Creation date: May 15, 2018
   Entry type: PrivateKeyEntry
   Certificate chain length: 1
   Certificate[1]:
   Owner: CN=[Adjust, GmbH.]
   Issuer: CN=[Adjust, GmbH.]
   Serial number: 642f1b62
   Valid from: Tue May 15 09:46:06 CEST 2018 until: Sat May 09

   Version: 3
   ```

3. Save the SHA-1 fingerprint to [add to your allowlist in the Adjust Suite](#add-your-digital-certificate-fingerprints-to-adjusts-allowlist).

#### From Google Play Internal App Sharing {#from-google-play-internal-app-sharing}

If you use [Google Play Internal App Sharing](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9303479?hl=en), you need to send both your organization’s SHA-1 certificate fingerprint and your Internal test certificate fingerprint to Adjust for allowlisting.

To extract the fingerprints:

1. Navigate to the Google Play Console and log in.
2. Select your app.
3. Select **Release Management --> App Releases --> Manage internal app sharing > App certificates**.
4. Save the **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint** for both the **Internal test certificate** and your organization’s keystore to [add to your allowlist in the Adjust Suite](#add-your-digital-certificate-fingerprints-to-adjusts-allowlist).

![A screenshot of the certficate page in Google Play Console](@images/sig-v3/google-play-internal-sharing.png)

#### From Google Play App Signing {#from-google-play-app-signing}

If you use [Google Play App Signing](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423?hl=en), you need to send both your organization’s SHA-1 certificate fingerprint and your Internal test certificate fingerprint to Adjust for allowlisting.

To extract the fingerprints:

1. Navigate to the Google Play Console and log in.
2. Select your app.
3. Select **Release Management > App Signing**.
4. Save the **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint** for both the **App signing certificate** and **Upload certificate** to send to Adjust.

#### From Huawei AppGallery App Signing {#from-huawei-appgallery-app-signing}

If you use Huawei AppGallery App Signing, you need to send both your organization’s SHA-1 certificate fingerprint and your Internal test certificate fingerprint to Adjust for allowlisting.

<Callout type="note">

If you use your own signing certificate with Huawei AppGallery, follow the [instructions for retrieving your certificate fingerprint from a keystore](#from-a-keystore).

</Callout>

To extract the fingerprints:

1. Navigate to the App Signing page in AppGallery Connect and download the App signing certificate (`certificate.pem`).

![A screenshot of the App Signing page in AppGallery Connect](@images/sig-v3/huawei-appgallery-signing.png)

2. Once you’ve downloaded the certificate, run the following command to output the SHA-1 fingerprint of the certificate.

   ```console
   $ openssl x509 -fingerprint -in certificate.pem -noout -SHA1
   ```

   The output looks like this:

   ```text
   SHA1 Fingerprint=C4:BD:07:91:BC:09:F8:B6:15:CD:BC:A3:3F:BC:68:8B:C2:EF:4F:F5
   ```

3. Save the fingerprint to [add to your allowlist in the Adjust Suite](#add-your-digital-certificate-fingerprints-to-adjusts-allowlist)..

### Add your digital certificate fingerprints to Adjust’s allowlist {#add-your-digital-certificate-fingerprints-to-adjust-s-allowlist}

<Callout type="note">

Remember to add all certificate fingerprints you want to use to the Adjust suite. This might include debug versions and versions for different stores.

</Callout>

Once you’ve obtained your certificate fingerprints, do the following to add them to your allowlist:

1. Select your app in AppView to open the app details screen.
2. Select the **Protection** tab.
3. Select the **Edit** button on the **Suspicious installs** section.
4. Under the **Android fingerprinting** section, select **New fingerprint**.
5. Paste the SHA-1 fingerprint into the text box that appears.
6. Select **Add**.

That’s it! Your fingerprint is now allowlisted for your app.

## Test your app {#test-your-app}

You can verify you have integrated the Signature library into your app using the [Adjust Testing Console](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/testing-console).

<Callout type="important">

You must ensure that the Adjust SDK is running in **Sandbox mode**.

</Callout>

To test your Signature library integration:

1. Fully delete your app from the test device to ensure the install information is sent.
2. Forget the device using the Testing Console to clear out all information relating to the device. You can also use the forget_device endpoint by passing your app token and the advertising ID you obtained from the [Adjust Insights app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adjust.insights). You can use any of the following advertising IDs: `adid`, `android_id`, `gps_adid`, `imei`, `oaid`.

   The call looks like this:

   ```console
   $ curl -X POST 'https://app.adjust.com/forget_device?app_token={yourAppToken}&id={adid}'
   ```

3. Once you’ve cleared the device from the Testing Console, install the app on your test device and launch it to send install information to Adjust.
4. Input the test device’s advertising ID into the Testing Console to fetch the install event information. Check the following:
   1. The `SignatureVerificationResult` field should show a value of `Valid Signature`
   2. The `SignatureVersion` field should show a value of `3`

If these fields are present and contain the correct information, you have successfully integrated the Signature library. If the fields display any other values, review the integration steps again or contact support@adjust.com for further assistance.

That’s it! You’ve successfully integrated the Signature library into your app. Once [two attribution windows have passed](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/attribution-windows), you can [enforce SDK signature validation](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/sdk-signature#enforce-signature-validation) to make sure that only signed requests are accepted by Adjust.

## Updating the Signature Library {#updating-the-signature-library}

Updating the Signature library consists of replacing the existing library with a newer version and rerunning your tests. You don't need to make any immediate changes to your app logic or settings in Adjust. Remember to [deactivate your secret IDs if they meet the following criteria](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/sdk-signature#manage-your-secret-ids):

- They're no longer contributing to your install reporting.
- You've fully released a new version of your app (across all app platforms and stores).
