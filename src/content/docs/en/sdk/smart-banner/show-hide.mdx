You can hide smart banners after initialization and show them again when needed. To do this, call the `AdjustSmartBanner.hide` method.

<Callout type="note">

Hiding a smart banner doesn't remove it from the DOM.

</Callout>

```js
AdjustSmartBanner.hide();
```

To show the smart banner again, call the `AdjustSmartBanner.show` method.

<Callout type="important">

If your web app is a SPA (Single Page Application), you should call this method after navigation occurs and the page URL changes. This forces the SDK to read the updated URL of the page, allowing it to find suitable banners for the current page or use updated GET parameters when it builds a link with a dynamic deep link.

</Callout>

```js
AdjustSmartBanner.show();
```
