This guide shows you how to migrate from Adjust's Purchase verification SDK to SDK v5's built-in purchase verification features. The SDK v5 purchase verification workflow is a streamlined approach to purchase verification.

With the Purchase Verification SDK, verification is split into three steps:

1. Initialize the Purchase Verification SDK.

```objc
#import "AdjustPurchase.h"
// or #import <AdjustPurchaseSdk/AdjustPurchase.h>

NSString *yourAppToken = @"{YourAppToken}";
NSString *environment = ADJPEnvironmentSandbox;

ADJPConfig *config = [[ADJPConfig alloc] initWithAppToken:yourAppToken andEnvironment:environment];
[AdjustPurchase init:config];
```

2. Verify your purchase.

```objc
[AdjustPurchase verifyPurchase:receipt
                forTransaction:transaction
                     productId:@"product-id"
             withResponseBlock:^(ADJPVerificationInfo *info) {
    // process ADJPVerificationInfo object
}];
```

3. Depending on the outcome of the verification, configure an `AdjustEvent` object and send it to Adjust.

```objc
NSURL *receiptURL = [[NSBundle mainBundle] appStoreReceiptURL];
NSData *receipt = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:receiptURL];
ADJEvent *event = [ADJEvent eventWithEventToken::@"your-event-token"];
[event setRevenue:6.0 currency:@"EUR"];
[event setTransactionId:@"transaction-id"];
[event setProductId:@"product-id"];
[event setReceipt:receipt];
[Adjust trackEvent:event];
```

In SDK v5, this workflow is simplified. The `[Adjust verifyAndTrackAppStorePurchase]` method allows you to send an event to Adjust's servers and receive the verification status as a callback. Adjust records the event and the verification status automatically.

## Guide {#guide}

Follow the steps in this guide to migrate from the Purchase Verification SDK to SDK v5 built-in purchase verification.

### 1. Uninstall the Purchase Verification SDK {#uninstall-the-pv-sdk}

To get started, uninstall the Adjust Purchase Verification SDK.

### 2. Remove Purchase Verification SDK code {#remove-pv-sdk-code}

Once you've uninstalled the Adjust Purchase Verification SDK, you must remove all Purchase Verification code from your project.

### 3. Migrate to SDK v5 purchase verification {#migrate-to-sdk-v5-pv}

Once you've removed the existing purchase verification code, you can replace it with SDK v5's built-in purchase verification methods. There are two ways to verify purchases with the Adjust SDK:

1. Create an `ADJEvent` object that represents your purchase and add the following properties:
   - `productId` (`NSString`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   - `transactionId` (`NSString`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
2. Create an `ADJAppStorePurchase` object with your product ID, transaction ID, and receipt.

<Callout type="tip">

If you use revenue events to measure your purchases in Adjust, you should use the `ADJEvent` class. If you only want to verify a purchase but don't want to associate it with an event, use the `ADJAppStorePurchase` class.

</Callout>

#### Record event and verify purchase {#record-event-and-verify-purchase}

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `ADJEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   - `productId` (`NSString`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   - `transactionId` (`NSString`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   - `event` (`ADJEvent`): Your instantiated event object.
   - `callback` (`ADJVerificationResultBlock`): A delegate callback function that receives an `ADJPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

      NSLog(@"Code: %d", verificationResult.code);
      NSLog(@"Message: %@", verificationResult.message);
}];
```

#### Only verify purchase {#only-verify-purchase}

To send a standalone purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `ADJAppStorePurchase` with the following arguments:
   - `transactionId` (`NSString`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
   - `productId` (`NSString`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAppStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   - `purchase` (`ADJAppStorePurchase`): Your instantiated purchase object.
   - `callback` (`ADJVerificationResultBlock`): A delegate callback function that receives an `ADJPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.
