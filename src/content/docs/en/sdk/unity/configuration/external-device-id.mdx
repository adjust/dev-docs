An external device identifier is a custom value that you can assign to a device or user. They help you recognize users across sessions and platforms. They can also help you deduplicate installs by user so that a user isn't counted as duplicate new installs. Contact your Adjust representative to get started with external device IDs.

You can use an external device ID as a custom identifier for a device. This helps you keep continuity with your other systems.
