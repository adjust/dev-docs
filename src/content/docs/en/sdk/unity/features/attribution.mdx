import Attribution from "@unity-examples/Adjust/getAttribution.mdx";

When a user interacts with a campaign link, their attribution information updates. This can happen if the user interacts with a [deep link](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/deep-links). The SDK can listen for attribution changes and call a function when it detects an update.

To configure your callback function, call the [`setAttributionChangedDelegate` method](#unity-setattributionchangeddelegate-invocation) with your function name as an argument.

<Callout type="important">

You must call the `setAttributionChangedDelegate` method **before** initializing the Adjust SDK in your app.

</Callout>

<SetAttributionChangedDelegate />

Within your delegate function, you have access to the user's `Attribution` information. See the [`AdjustAttribution` class reference](/en/sdk/unity/reference/adjustattribution) for a list of available properties.

## Get current attribution information

When a user installs your app, Adjust attributes the install to a campaign. The Adjust SDK gives you access to campaign attribution details for your install. To return this information, call the [`attribution` method](#ios-attribution-invocation).

This method returns an Attribution object. See the [`AdjustAttribution` class reference](/en/sdk/unity/reference/adjustattribution) for a list of available properties.

<Attribution />
