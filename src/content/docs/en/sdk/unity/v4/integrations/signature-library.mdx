<Callout type="note">

This page refers to integration steps for the Adjust SDK v4. If you're using the Adjust SDK v5, please select the appropriate tab on the dropdown menu to your left.

</Callout>

Adjust's SDK Signature library is designed to be a standalone plugin for the Adjust SDK. This means you don’t need to change any of your code or change how you use the Adjust SDK in your app. Once you install the plugin, all requests made by the Adjust SDK will continue to work as expected.

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

<Callout type="note">

The Signature library is configured to use [16KB page sizes](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes) in [version 3.32.0 or greater](https://github.com/adjust/adjust_signature_sdk/releases/tag/v3.32.0).

</Callout>

To integrate the Signature library into your Unity app, ensure the following:

- The Android API version in use is **21 or greater**.
- The Adjust SDK version in use is **4.37.2 or greater**. This requirement applies even when the Adjust SDK is used indirectly.
- If you use Proguard, you must use the exact same Proguard configuration for both the Signature library and the Adjust SDK.

<Callout type="important">

Using external obfuscation tools with the Adjust SDK or Signature library can impact the functionality of the Signature library. If you're unsure about using an external tool, reach out to your Adjust representative or email support@adjust.com to check if functionality is impacted.

</Callout>

### Migrating from Signature v1 or v2 library {#migrating-from-signature-v1-or-v2-library}

If you previously used Signature v1 or Signature v2, you first need to remove the previous version before integrating the Signature library. To do this:

- If you previously integrated Signature v1, remove any code that calls to signature functions in your project.
- If you previously integrated Signature v2, remove the Signature v2 library from your project.

## Integrate the signature library {#integrate-the-signature-library}

Follow these steps to integrate the Signature library in your Unity project.

1. Fetch from GitHub the [latest Stable](https://github.com/adjust/adjust_signature_sdk/releases/latest) or [Beta](https://github.com/adjust/adjust_signature_sdk/releases) version.
2. Place the Android archive (`.aar`) file in the `Assets/Adjust/Android` directory inside your Unity project.
3. Place the iOS static framework (`.a`) in the `Assets/Adjust/iOS` directory inside your Unity project.

That’s it! The Signature library is now integrated into your project. Follow the steps in the next section to configure your digital certificates.

## Set up your certificates in the Adjust suite {#set-up-your-certificates-in-the-adjust-suite}

<Callout type="note">

This step is only required if your app targets **Android**.

</Callout>

Once you integrate the Signature library into your app, all requests sent by the Adjust SDK to Adjust are signed. The Adjust SDK will also transmit relevant information to Adjust’s servers, including the fingerprint of your signing certificate.

A certificate fingerprint is a cryptographic hash of the public information held within a certificate. It can be used to verify the authenticity of an app.

The Signature library can’t verify the authenticity of your certificate fingerprints. The fingerprints need to be added to an allowlist in the Adjust Suite in order for requests containing them to be accepted by Adjust as authentic. To do this, you need to retrieve the certificate fingerprints and send them to Adjust.

<Callout type="important">

You must add the fingerprints of your signing certificates to the allowlist. If no fingerprints are added to the allowlist, traffic from your app can be spoofed.

Remember to add all certificate fingerprints you want to use to the Adjust suite. This might include debug versions and versions for different stores.

</Callout>

Follow these steps to retrieve and configure your certificate fingerprints:

1. [Retrieve Android certificate fingerprints](/en/sdk/android/integrations/retrieve-certificate-fingerprints)
2. [Configure them in the Adjust dashboard](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/sdk-signature#add-signatures-in-the-adjust-suite)

## Test your app {#test-your-app}

You can verify you have integrated the Signature library into your app using the [Adjust Testing Console](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/testing-console).

<Callout type="important">

You must ensure that the Adjust SDK is running in **Sandbox mode**.

</Callout>

To test your Signature library integration:

1. Fully delete your app from the test device to ensure the install information is sent.
2. Forget the device using the Testing Console to clear out all information relating to the device. You can also use the forget_device endpoint by passing your app token and the advertising ID you obtained from the Adjust Insights app (available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adjust-insights/id1125517808) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adjust.insights)). You can use any of the following advertising IDs: `adid`, `android_id`, `gps_adid`, `idfa`, `idfv`, `imei`, `oaid`.

   The call looks like this:

   ```console
   $ curl -X POST 'https://app.adjust.com/forget_device?app_token={yourAppToken}&id={adid}'
   ```

3. Once you’ve cleared the device from the Testing Console, install the app on your test device and launch it to send install information to Adjust.
4. Input the test device’s advertising ID into the Testing Console to fetch the install event information. Check the following:
   1. The `SignatureVerificationResult` field should show a value of `Valid Signature`
   2. The `SignatureVersion` field should show a value of `3`

If these fields are present and contain the correct information, you have successfully integrated the Signature library. If the fields display any other values, review the integration steps again or contact support@adjust.com for further assistance.

That’s it! You’ve successfully integrated the Signature library into your app. Once [two attribution windows have passed](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/attribution-windows), you can [enforce SDK signature validation](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/sdk-signature#enforce-signature-validation) to make sure that only signed requests are accepted by Adjust.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### Upload symbols failed

When validating or submitting apps built with Xcode 16, you may encounter an `Upload symbols failed` warning related to the Signature library. This missing symbols condition is intentional and doesn't affect functionality, so it's safe to ignore.

### Unknown CPU Architecture in AdjustSigSdk.a {#unknown-cpu-architecture-in-adjustsigsdk-a}

In Unity Editor 2018 and later, you may receive an error message containing **Unknown CPU Architecture**. This error message is shown when the Unity Editor tries to apply the iOS static framework (`.a`) to non-iOS platforms. To fix the issue, select the `AdjustSigSdk.a` file and deselect all platforms except **iOS** in the **Import Settings** menu.

## Updating the Signature Library {#updating-the-signature-library}

Updating the Signature library consists of replacing the existing library with a newer version and rerunning your tests. You don't need to make any immediate changes to your app logic or settings in Adjust. Remember to [deactivate your secret IDs if they meet the following criteria](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/sdk-signature#manage-your-secret-ids):

- They're no longer contributing to your install reporting.
- You've fully released a new version of your app (across all app platforms and stores).
