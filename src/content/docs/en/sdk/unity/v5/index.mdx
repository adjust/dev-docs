The Adjust Unity SDK enables you to record attribution, events, and more in your Unity app. Follow the steps in this guide to set up your app to work with the Adjust SDK.

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

Here's what you need to know before you get started:

- The Adjust SDK supports iOS 12 or later and Android API level 21 (Lollipop) or later.
- The Adjust SDK is compatible with Unity Editor 2018.2 or later.

## 1. Get the Adjust SDK {#get-the-adjust-sdk}

To install the Adjust SDK, choose one of the following methods.

### Install the Unity package {#install-unity-package}

To use the Adjust SDK in your Unity app, you need to add it to your project. You can download the latest version from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/adjust/adjust_unity_sdk/releases/latest).

To import the Adjust SDK into your Unity project:

1. Open the Unity Editor.
1. Select **Assets --> Import Package --> Custom Package**.
1. Select the downloaded SDK package.

### Use the Unity Package Manager {#use-the-unity-package-manager}

To install the Adjust SDK with the Unity Package Manager, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Package Manager** window in the Unity editor.
1. Select **Add package from git URL**.
1. Enter the following URL: `https://github.com/adjust/unity_sdk.git?path=Assets/Adjust`.

## 2. Install the iOS and Android SDKs {#install-ios-and-android-sdks}

<MinorVersion
   changed="v5.0.4"
   link="https://github.com/adjust/unity_sdk/releases/tag/v5.0.4"
>
   SDK v5 no longer uses the iOS and Android SDKs as binary dependencies. To
   install the underlying iOS and Android SDKs, you need to use the [External
   Dependency Manager for Unity
   (EDM4U)](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver) to install the
   packages from CocoaPods and Maven.
</MinorVersion>

## 3. Integrate the SDK {#integrate-the-sdk}

The Adjust SDK contains a Unity [prefab](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html) that includes a template game object and an Adjust script. You can use this script to configure the SDK. To open the prefab in the Unity editor:

1. Add the prefab from `Assets/Adjust/Adjust.prefab` to your first scene.
1. Open the prefab Inspector Menu.
1. The prefab menu contains editable fields that control the behavior of the Adjust SDK.

![A screenshot of the Adjust SDK prefab configuration script in the Unity editor.](@images/unity/1-prefab.png)

To set up the Adjust SDK, enter the following information:

1. Your **App Token**. See App settings for instructions on how to find your token.
1. Your **Environment**:
   - Choose **Sandbox** if you are testing your app and want to send test data. You need to enable sandbox mode in the dashboard to see test data.
   - Choose **Production** when you have finished testing and are ready to release your app.
1. Your **Log Level**. This controls what logs you receive. See [Set log level](/en/sdk/unity/configuration#set-your-logging-level) for more information.

The Adjust SDK starts when the app's Awake event triggers by default. To override this behavior, check the **START SDK MANUALLY** option. This enables you to initialize the Adjust SDK by calling `Adjust.InitSdk` with your config instance as an argument.

```cs
AdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig("{YourAppToken}", AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox);
Adjust.InitSdk(adjustConfig);
```

## 4. Set up Android devices {#set-up-android-devices}

### Add Google Play Services {#add-google-play-services}

Apps that target the Google Play Store must use the gps_adid (Google Advertising ID) to identify devices. You need to add the `play-services-ads-identifier` AAR to your project to access the `gps_adid`.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="EDM4U" sync="edm4u">
If you are using the [External Dependency Manager plugin](https://developers.google.com/unity/archive#external_dependency_manager_for_unity), add the following to your `Dependencies.xml` file:

```xml
<androidPackages>
   <androidPackage spec="com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:18.0.1" />
</androidPackages>
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Manual installation" sync="manual">
To install the ARR (Android Archive) manually, [download it from Maven](https://maven.google.com/web/index.html#com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:18.0.1 "A link to the AAR artifact on Maven.") and add it to the `Assets/Plugins/Android` directory.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Collect App Set Identifier {#collect-app-set-identifier}

The [App Set Identifier](https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/privacy-sandbox/reference/adservices/appsetid/AppSetId) is a unique identifier that enables you to measure information from any of your apps that a user has installed on their device. All apps by the same developer share the same App Set ID, meaning you can gather meaningful insights from users across all your apps.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="EDM4U" sync="edm4u">
To record a device's App Set ID, you need to add the following dependency to your `Dependencies.xml` file:

```xml
<androidPackages>
   <androidPackage spec="com.google.android.gms:play-services-appset:16.0.2" />
</androidPackages>
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Manual installation" sync="manual">
To install the ARR (Android Archive) manually, [download it from Maven](https://maven.google.com/web/index.html#com.google.android.gms:play-services-appset:16.0.2 "A link to the AAR artifact on Maven.") and add it to the `Assets/Plugins/Android` directory.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Set up install referrer

The install referrer is a unique identifier which you can use to attribute an app install to a source. The Adjust SDK requires this information to perform attribution. There can gather this information using the [Google Play Referrer API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/installreferrer).

There are 2 ways to add support for the Google Play Referrer API:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="EDM4U" sync="edm4u">
Add the install referrer library as a dependency in a [custom `build.gradle` file](https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.1/Documentation/Manual/android-gradle-overview.html)

```groovy
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:2.2'
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Manual installation" sync="manual">
Download the install referrer library from [Maven](https://maven.google.com/web/index.html?q=install#com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer) and put the ARR (Android Archive) file in your `Plugins/Android` folder.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Meta referrer integration

The Adjust SDK supports the [Meta Install Referrer](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-ads/meta-install-referrer) using the Adjust Meta Install Referrer plugin. [See the Unity Meta Install Referrer plugin for integration details](/en/sdk/unity/plugins/meta-referrer-plugin).

## 5. Set up SDK Signature {#set-up-sdk-signature}

If you want to use the SDK signature library to secure communications between the Adjust SDK and Adjust's servers, follow the instructions in the [SDK signature guide on the Adjust Help Center](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/sdk-signature).

## 6. Build your app {#build-your-app}

To complete the app build process, the Adjust Unity package performs custom post-build actions to ensure the Adjust SDK works in your app. This process is performed by the `OnPostprocessBuild` method in `AdjustEditor.cs`.

You can configure post-build options to customize your app build.

![A screenshot of the Adjust SDK post-build configuration script in the Unity editor.](@images/unity/2-postbuild.png)

### iOS {#ios}

<Callout type="important">
   To run the iOS post-build process, make sure that you have **iOS build
   support** installed in the Unity Editor.
</Callout>

The iOS post-build process makes the following changes to your generated Xcode project:

- Enables Objective-C exceptions.

#### Frameworks

You can enable the following frameworks to access iOS features:

- `AdServices.framework`: Required for Apple Search Ads measurement
- `AdSupport.framework`: Required to read the device IDFA
- `AppTrackingTransparency.framework`: Required to ask for user's consent to be measured and obtain consent status
- `StoreKit.framework`: Required to communicate with the SKAdNetwork framework.

#### App Tracking Transparency consent dialog

If you are using the ATT (App Tracking Transparency) wrapper, enter a **User Tracking Description** message. This displays when you present the ATT consent dialog to your user.

#### Deep linking

To enable deep linking, add the following information:

- **iOS Universal Links Domain**: The associated domain used for universal links.
- **iOS URL Identifier**: Your app's bundle ID.
- **iOS URL Schemes**: The URL scheme associated with your app.

### Android {#android}

The Android post-build process checks for an `AndroidManifest.xml` file in `Assets/Plugins/Android/`. If this file isn't present, it creates a copy from [`AdjustAndroidManifest.xml`](https://github.com/adjust/unity_sdk/blob/master/Assets/Adjust/Native/Android/AdjustAndroidManifest.xml "A link to the AdjustAndroidManifest file on GitHub").

#### Permissions

You can enable the following permissions to access Android features:

- `android.permission.INTERNET`: Required to connect to the internet.
- `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`: Required to read the type of network the device is connected to.
- `com.android.finsky.permission.BIND_GET_INSTALL_REFERRER_SERVICE` **Deprecated**: Required to fetch install referrer information via Google Play Store intent.
- `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID`: Required to read the device advertising ID on Android 12 (API level 31) and above. See [Google's `AdvertisingIdClient.info` documentation](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info#public-string-getid) for more information.

#### Deep linking

To enable deep linking, add the following information:

**Android URI Schemes**: The destination of your deep link.

The output of the process is shown in the Unity IDE console window.

## 7. Test your integration {#test-your-integration}

<Callout type="tip">
   If you encounter any issues, email support@adjust.com with all details and
   logs.
</Callout>

The Adjust SDK provides tools for testing and troubleshooting issues with your integration. To test your setup:

- Set your environment to `AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox`.
- Add a sandbox filter to your Adjust dashboard results.
- Set your [log level](/en/sdk/unity/configuration#set-your-logging-level) to `AdjustLogLevel.Verbose`.

### Test Google Play Services integration {#test-google-play-services-integration}

To test that the Adjust SDK can receive a device's Google Advertising ID, set the [log level](/en/sdk/unity/configuration#set-your-logging-level) to `AdjustLogLevel.Verbose` and the environment to `AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox`. Start your app and measure a `session` or an event. The SDK logs the gps_adid (Google Play Services Advertiser ID) parameter if it has read the advertising ID.

If you are having issues retrieving the Google Advertising ID, open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adjust/unity_sdk) or contact support@adjust.com.
