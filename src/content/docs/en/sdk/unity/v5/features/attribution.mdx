When a user interacts with an Adjust link, their attribution information updates. This can happen if the user interacts with a [deep link](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/deep-links). Information about a user's attribution is represented in the `AdjustAttribution` class.

## AdjustAttribution class properties {#adjustattribution-class-properties}

The `AdjustAttribution` class contains details about the current attribution status of the device. Any values that aren't populated for the user are returned as a `null` value.

<Callout type="note">

The following values can only be accessed if the [`IsCostDataInAttributionEnabled` property on your `AdjustConfig` instance](/en/sdk/android/configuration#enable-cost-data-sending) is `true`:

-  `costType`
-  `costAmount`
-  `costCurrency`

</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">

To get the Adjust Device ID, use the `Adjust.getAdid` method. For more details, go to [Get device information](/en/sdk/android/features/device-info#adjust-device-identifier).

## Trigger a function when attribution changes {#trigger-a-function-when-attribution-changes}

<CodeBlock title="Property declaration">

```cs
public Action<AdjustAttribution> AttributionChangedDelegate { get; set; }
```

</CodeBlock>

The SDK can listen for attribution changes and call a function when it detects an update. To configure your callback function, assign a function to the `AttributionChangedDelegate` of your `AdjustConfig` instance.

<Callout type="important">

You must set this property **before** initializing the Adjust SDK in your app.

</Callout>

<CodeBlock highlight="{range: 8}, {range: 13-16}">

```cs
using com.adjust.sdk;

public class ExampleGUI : MonoBehaviour {
   void OnGUI() {
      if (GUI.Button(new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height), "callback")) {
         AdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig("{Your App Token}", AdjustEnvironmentSandbox);
         adjustConfig.LogLevel = AdjustLogLevel.Verbose;
         adjustConfig.AttributionChangedDelegate = this.AttributionChangedDelegate;
         Adjust.InitSdk(adjustConfig);
      }
   }

   public void AttributionChangedDelegate(AdjustAttribution attribution) {
      Debug.Log("Attribution changed");
      // ...
   }
}
```

</CodeBlock>

## Get current attribution information {#get-current-attribution-information}

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cs
public static void GetAttribution(Action<AdjustAttribution> callback)
```

</CodeBlock>

When a user installs your app, Adjust attributes the install to a campaign. The Adjust SDK gives you access to campaign attribution details for your install. To return this information, call the `Adjust.GetAttribution` method and pass a callback function. The SDK fetches the attribution information asynchronously and passes it to your completion handler as an `AdjustAttribution` object.

```cs
Adjust.GetAttribution(attribution =>
{
    // use attribution
});
```
