If you want to record the device's ID for Advertisers (IDFA), you must display a prompt to get your user's authorization. To do this, you need to include Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework in your app. The Adjust SDK stores the user's authorization status and sends it to Adjust's servers with each request.

## Authorization statuses

| Status                                              | Code | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined` | `0`  | The user hasn't responded to the access prompt yet                   |
| `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted`    | `1`  | Access to app-related data is blocked at the device level            |
| `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied`        | `2`  | The user has denied access to app-related data for device tracking   |
| `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized`    | `3`  | The user has approved access to app-related data for device tracking |

<Callout type="note">

You might receive a status code of `-1` if the SDK is unable to retrieve the ATT (App Tracking Transparency) status.

## App-tracking authorization wrapper

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cpp
static void requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler(void (*trackingStatusCallback)(int status));
```

</CodeBlock>

The Adjust SDK contains a wrapper around [Apple's `requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler` method](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency/attrackingmanager/3547037-requesttrackingauthorizationwith). You can use this wrapper if you don't want to customize the ATT prompt.

The callback method triggers when your user responds to the consent dialog. This method sends the user's consent status code to Adjust's servers. You can define responses to each status code within the callback function.

You must specify text content for the tracking request dialog. To do this, add your text to the `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` key in your `Info.plist` file.

<Callout type="tip">

The Adjust SDK also records the consent status if you use a custom prompt. If you show your prompt before initialization, the SDK sends the status with the install event. If you show it after initialization, the SDK sends the status to Adjust's servers as soon as the user updates it.

</Callout>

```cpp
static void authorizationStatusCallback(int status) {
    switch (status) {
        case 0:
            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined case
            break;
        case 1:
            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted case
            break;
        case 2:
            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied case
            break;
        case 3:
            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized case
            break;
    }
}

// ...

Adjust2dx::requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler(authorizationStatusCallback);
```

### Example

This example shows how to log a human-readable description of the user's authorization status when they interact with a prompt.

```cpp
static void authorizationStatusCallback(int status) {
    switch (status) {
        case 0:
            CCLOG("The user hasn't responded to the access prompt yet.");
            break;
        case 1:
            CCLOG(("Access to app-related data is blocked at the device level.");)
            break;
        case 2:
            CCLOG("The user has denied access to app-related data for device tracking.");
            break;
        case 3:
            CCLOG("The user has approved access to app-related data for device tracking.");
            break;
    }
}

Adjust2dx::requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler(authorizationStatusCallback);
```

## Get current authorization status

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cpp
static int getAppTrackingAuthorizationStatus();
```

</CodeBlock>

You can retrieve a user's current authorization status at any time. Call the `getAppTrackingAuthorizationStatus` method to return the authorization status code as an **integer**.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::getAppTrackingAuthorizationStatus();
```

### Example

This example shows how to collect the user's authorization status and convert it to a `String`. This information is assigned to a variable called `authorizationStatus` and passed as a session partner parameter with the key `"status"`.

```cpp
std::string authorizationStatus = Adjust2dx::getAppTrackingAuthorizationStatus().c_str();
Adjust2dx::addSessionPartnerParameter("status", authorizationStatus);
```

## Check for authorization status changes

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cpp
static void checkForNewAttStatus();
```

</CodeBlock>

If you use a custom ATT prompt, you need to inform the Adjust SDK of changes to the user's authorization status. Call the `checkForNewAttStatus` method to send the authorization status to Adjust's servers.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::checkForNewAttStatus();
```
