If you want to record the device's ID for Advertisers (IDFA), you must display a prompt to get your user's authorization. To do this, you need to include Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework in your app. The Adjust SDK stores the user's authorization status and sends it to Adjust's servers with each request.

## Authorization statuses {#authorization-statuses}

| Status                                              | Code | Description                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined` | `0`  | The user hasn't responded to the access prompt yet                      |
| `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted`    | `1`  | Access to app-related data is blocked at the device level               |
| `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied`        | `2`  | The user has denied access to app-related data for device measurement   |
| `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized`    | `3`  | The user has approved access to app-related data for device measurement |

If the SDK is unable to retrieve the ATT status, it returns a value of `-1`.

## Show consent prompt {#show-consent-prompt}

The Adjust SDK contains a wrapper around [Apple's `requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler` method](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency/attrackingmanager/3547037-requesttrackingauthorizationwith). You can use this wrapper if you don't want to customize the ATT prompt.

The callback method triggers when your user responds to the consent dialog. This method sends the user's consent status code to Adjust's servers. You can define responses to each status code within the callback function.

You must specify text content for the tracking request dialog. To do this, add your text to the `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` key in your `Info.plist` file.

<Callout type="tip">

The Adjust SDK also records the consent status if you use a custom prompt. If you show your prompt before initialization, the SDK sends the status with the install event. If you show it after initialization, the SDK sends the status to Adjust's servers as soon as the user updates it.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::requestAppTrackingAuthorization([] (int status) {
    switch (status) {
        case 0:
            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined case
            break;
        case 1:
            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted case
            break;
        case 2:
            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied case
            break;
        case 3:
            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized case
            break;
    }
});
```

## Customize prompt timing {#customize-prompt-timing}

If your app includes an onboarding process or a tutorial, you may want to delay sending your user's ATT consent status until after the user has completed this process. To do this, you can call the `setAttConsentWaitingInterval` method on your `AdjustConfig2dx` instance to delay the sending of data for **up to 360 seconds** to give the user time to complete the initial onboarding. After the timeout ends or the user sets their consent status, the SDK sends all information it has recorded during the delay to Adjust's servers along with the user's consent status.

If the user closes the app before the timeout ends, or before they select their consent status, the timeout restarts when they reopen the app.

```cpp
AdjustConfig2dx adjustConfig = AdjustConfig2dx(appToken, environment);
adjustConfig.setAttConsentWaitingInterval({$variables.config.attWaitingInterval});
Adjust2dx::initSdk(adjustConfig);
```

## Get current authorization status {#get-current-authorization-status}

You can retrieve a user's current authorization status at any time. Call the `Adjust2dx::getAppTrackingAuthorizationStatus()` method to return the authorization status code as an `int`.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::getAppTrackingAuthorizationStatus();
```
