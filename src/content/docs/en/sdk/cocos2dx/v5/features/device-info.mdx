The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.

## Adjust device identifier {#adid}

Adjust generates a unique Adjust Device ID (ADID) for each device. Call the `getAdid` method to asynchronously return the ADID as a `std::string` to a delegate function.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::getAdid([](std::string adId) {
    std::cout << "\nAdjust ID = " << adid;
});
```

## ID For Advertisers {#idfa}

The ID for Advertisers (IDFA) is a device-specific identifier for Apple devices. Call the `getIdfa` method to asynchronously return the IDFA as a `std::string` to a delegate function.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::getIdfa([](std::string idfa) {
    std::cout << "\nIDFA = " << idfa;
});
```

## ID For Vendor {#idfv}

The ID for Vendor (IDFV) is a device-specific identifier for Apple devices. Call the `getIdfv` method to asynchronously return the IDFV as a `std::string` to a delegate function.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::getIdfv([](std::string idfv) {
    std::cout << "\nIDFV = " << idfa;
});
```

## Google Play Services Advertising ID {#google-adid}

The Google Play Services Advertising ID (GPS ADID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices.

Users can opt out of sharing their GPS ADID by toggling the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting on their device. When a user enables this setting, the Adjust SDK returns a string of zeros when trying to read the GPS ADID.

You can access this value by calling the `getGoogleAdId` method in a background thread. Assign a delegate function to access the GPS ADID value.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::getGoogleAdId([](std::string googleAdId) {
    std::cout << "\nGoogle Ad ID = " << googleAdId;
});
```

## Amazon Advertiser ID {#amazon-adid}

The Amazon Advertising ID (Amazon Ad ID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices. Call the `getAmazonAdId` method to asynchronously return the Amazon Ad ID as a `std::string` to a delegate function.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::getAmazonAdId([](std::string amazonAdId) {
    std::cout << "\nAmazon Ad ID = " << amazonAdId;
});
```

## Adjust SDK version {#sdk-version-getter}

To read the version of the Adjust SDK, pass a callback function to the `getSdkVersion` method. The SDK fetches the information asynchronously and passes it to your callback function.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::getSdkVersion([](std::string sdkVersion) {
    std::cout << "\nSDK version = " << sdkVersion;
});
```
