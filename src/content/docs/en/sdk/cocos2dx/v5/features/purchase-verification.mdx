If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you can use the Adjust SDK to request purchase verification. There are two ways to verify purchases with the Adjust SDK:

1. Create an `AdjustEvent2dx` object that represents your purchase and configure purchase properties for the target store.
1. Create an `AdjustAppStorePurchase2dx` (Apple App Store) or `AdjustPlayStorePurchase2dx` (Google Play Store) object representing the purchase.

<Callout type="tip">

If you use revenue events to measure your purchases in Adjust, you should use the `AdjustEvent2dx` class. If you only want to verify a purchase but don't want to associate it with an event, use the `AdjustAppStorePurchase2dx` or `AdjustPlayStorePurchase2dx` class.

</Callout>

When you send purchase information with the Adjust SDK, Adjust does the following:

1. Sends the information to the relevant store and waits for a status response.
1. Forwards the status response to the Adjust SDK.

You can access the purchase verification status by using a callback. Results are returned as `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult2dx` objects containing the following properties:

<DefList>

`verificationStatus` (`std::string`)

: The status of the purchase.

`code` (`int`)

: The status code of the purchase.

`message` (`std::string`)

: Any message returned by the store.

</DefList>

## Verify purchase and record event {#verify-purchase-and-record-event}

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps.

### App Store purchases {#app-store-purchases}

1. Instantiate an `AdjustEvent2dx` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:

<DefList>

`productId` (`std::string`)

: The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.

`transactionId` (`std::string`)

: The ID of the transaction you want to verify.

</DefList>

1. Call the `Adjust2dx::verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:

<DefList>

`event` (`AdjustEvent2dx`)

: Your instantiated event object.

`callback` (`void(*callback)`)

: A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult2dx` object as an argument.

</DefList>

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```cpp
AdjustEvent2dx adjustEvent = AdjustEvent2dx("{variables.event.token}");
adjustEvent.setRevenue({variables.event.revenue.amount}, "{variables.event.revenue.currency}");
adjustEvent.setTransactionId("{variables.event.transactionId}");
adjustEvent.setProductId("{variables.event.revenue.productId}");
Adjust2dx::verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase(adjustEvent, [](AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult2dx verificationResult) {
    log("Verification status:s", verificationResult.verificationStatus);
    log("Code:s", verificationResult.code);
    log("Message:s", verificationResult.message);
});
```

### Play Store purchases {#play-store-purchases}

1. Instantiate an `AdjustEvent2dx` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:

<DefList>

`productId` (`std::string`)

: The ID of the product that has been purchased.

`purchaseToken` (`std::string`)

: The purchase token associated with the purchase.

</DefList>

1. Call the `Adjust::verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:

<DefList>

`event` (`AdjustEvent2dx`)

: Your instantiated event object.

`callback` (`void(*callback)`)

: A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult2dx` object as an argument.

</DefList>

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```cpp
AdjustEvent2dx adjustEvent = AdjustEvent("{variables.event.token}");
adjustEvent.setRevenue({variables.event.revenue.amount}, "{variables.event.revenue.currency}");
adjustEvent.setProductId("{variables.event.productId}");
adjustEvent.setPurchaseToken("{variables.event.revenue.purchaseToken}");
Adjust2dx::verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase(adjustEvent, [](AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult2dx verificationResult) {
    log("Verification status:s", verificationResult.verificationStatus);
    log("Code:s", verificationResult.code);
    log("Message:s", verificationResult.message);
});
```

## Only verify purchase {#only-verify-purchase}

To send standalone purchase information and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

### App Store purchases {#app-store-only-verify}

1. Instantiate an `AdjustAppStorePurchase2dx` object with the following arguments:

<DefList>

`productId` (`std::string`)

: The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.

`transactionId` (`std::string`)

: The ID of the transaction you want to verify.

</DefList>

1. Call the `Adjust2dx::verifyAppStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:

<DefList>

`purchase` (`AdjustAppStorePurchase2dx`)

: Your instantiated purchase object.

`callback` (`void(*callback)`)

: A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult2dx` object as an argument.

</DefList>

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```cpp
AdjustAppStorePurchase2dx purchase = AdjustAppStorePurchase2dx("{variables.event.productId}", "{variables.event.transactionId}");
Adjust2dx::verifyAppStorePurchase(purchase, [](AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult2dx verificationResult) {
    log("Verification status:s", verificationResult.verificationStatus);
    log("Code:s", verificationResult.code);
    log("Message:s", verificationResult.message);
});
```

### Play Store purchases {#play-store-only-verify}

1. Instantiate an `AdjustPlayStorePurchase2dx` with the following arguments:

<DefList>

`productId` (`std::string`)

: The ID of the product that has been purchased.

`purchaseToken` (`std::string`)

: The purchase token associated with the purchase.

</DefList>

1. Call the `Adjust2dx::verifyPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:

<DefList>

`purchase` (`AdjustPlayStorePurchase2dx`)

: Your instantiated purchase object.

`callback` (`void(*callback)`)

: A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult2dx` object as an argument.

</DefList>

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```cpp
AdjustPlayStorePurchase2dx purchase = AdjustPlayStorePurchase2dx("{variables.event.productId}", "{variables.event.purchaseToken}");
Adjust2dx::verifyPlayStorePurchase(purchase, [](AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult2dx verificationResult) {
    log("Verification status:s", verificationResult.verificationStatus);
    log("Code:s", verificationResult.code);
    log("Message:s", verificationResult.message);
});
```
