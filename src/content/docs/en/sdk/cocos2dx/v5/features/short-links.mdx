Adjust's [link shortener solution](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/short-branded-links) converts your complex and long links into cleaner and shorter links. The shortened links retain deep link and campaign information, and route users to the app store, if they don't have your app installed.

Use the method described in this section to resolve your short links.

## Set up deep linking in the Adjust SDK {#set-up-deep-linking-in-the-adjust-sdk}

<Callout type="note">

You don't need to set up LinkMe or Link resolution to use Adjustâ€™s link shortener solution.

</Callout>

In the Adjust SDK, add support for the following:

- [URI schemes](/en/sdk/cocos2dx/features/deep-links)
- [Deferred deep linking](/en/sdk/cocos2dx/features/deep-links#deferred-deep-linking)

## Set up the Adjust SDK to resolve short links {#set-up-the-adjust-sdk-to-resolve-short-links}

To resolve a short Adjust link URL that deep linked users into your app, call the `Adjust2dx::processAndResolveDeeplink` method with the following arguments:

<DefList>

`deeplink` (`AdjustDeeplink2dx`)

: The deep link you want to resolve.

`resolvedLinkCallback` (`void(std::string)`)

: A function that receives the resolved deep link. Must return `void`.

</DefList>

```cpp
AdjustDeeplink2dx deeplink = AdjustDeeplink2dx("url");
Adjust2dx::processAndResolveDeeplink(deeplink, [](std::string resolvedLink) {
    // process resolvedLink
});
```

If you pass a shortened link to the `Adjust2dx::processAndResolveDeeplink` method, you receive the original expanded link in your `deeplinkResolvedCallback` function. If you pass a non-shortened link, the `deeplinkResolvedCallback` function receives the link you passed to `Adjust2dx::processAndResolveDeeplink` without modification.
