If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you must send additional information with your purchase events to verify them. When Adjust's servers receive this information in an `ADJEvent` object, they forward it to Apple to verify the purchase.

To verify a purchase, instantiate an `ADJEvent` object with your event token and set the following properties:

- `transactionId` (`NSString`): The [`transactionIdentifier` value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransaction/1411288-transactionidentifier) of the successfully completed purchase
- `productId` (`NSString`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased
- `receipt` (`NSData`): The [signed receipt](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle/1407276-appstorereceipturl) containing the information about the successfully completed purchase

See [Send event information](/en/sdk/ios/features/events) for more information on the `ADJEvent` class.
