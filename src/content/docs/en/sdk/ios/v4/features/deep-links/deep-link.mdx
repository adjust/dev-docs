You need to configure your app in Adjust to enable deep linking. To do this, make sure you have done the following:

-  [ ] [Added your app in Adjust](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/app-setup).
-  [ ] Retrieved all the required deep linking data.

## Set up universal links in your app {#set-up-universal-links-in-your-app}

To enable deep linking support for iOS 9 and later you need to set up universal links in Adjust.

You can enter only one Bundle ID per app. If you are testing an app with a Debug Bundle ID, you need to create a separate app.

Once you have gathered your setup data, you can add this to your app in Adjust. Adding the information to your app enables you to add deep links to your campaigns. To set up universal links, follow these steps:

1. Go to **AppView** and select your app.
2. Ensure the **iOS bundle ID** is present.
3. Under **Device type**, choose your app's default device:
   -  Universal - iPhone and iPad
   -  iPhone
   -  iPad
4. Under **Universal linking**, turn on Enable universal linking to enable universal links for your app.
   -  Enter the **App ID prefix**.
   -  Enter the **App scheme**.
5. (Optional) Turn on **Redirect all clicks to a custom URL** and enter a **Custom URL**, if you want your users to go to a custom website instead of the App Store. This is recommended if your app doesn't have an App ID.
6. (Optional) Turn on **Send data to App Store Connect** and enter the **Apple provider ID** to send data to App Store Connect App Analytics.
7. Select **Save**.

## Set up deep links with a custom URL scheme {#set-up-deep-links-with-a-custom-url-scheme}

In this case, you need to pick a custom URL scheme name which your app will be responsible for opening. You can then use this scheme name in the Adjust link as part of the deep link parameter.

To create a deep link with a custom URL scheme, follow these steps:

1. Define the format of your custom URL scheme. If you are using a cross-platform framework, refer to the documentation for that framework to define the format of your custom URL scheme. Example: `example://summer-clothes?promo=beach`
2. URL encode the deep link. Example: `example%3A%2F%2Fsummer-clothes%3Fpromo%3Dbeach`
3. Pass this encoded deep link into an Adjust link. Example: `https://app.adjust.com/abc123?deeplink=%3A%2F%2Fsummer-clothes%3Fpromo%3Dbeach`
4. Append the `deeplink_js=1` parameter to the link with the encoded deep link. This forces the Adjust system to use the iOS custom URL scheme. Example: `https://app.adjust.com/abc123?deeplink_js=1&deeplink=%3A%2F%2Fsummer-clothes%3Fpromo%3Dbeach`
