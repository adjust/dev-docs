Before using this integration, read through the [conditions for usage](https://github.com/adjust/sdks/blob/master/doc/attribution-data.md) of some of your data.

You can integrate the Adjust SDK with the Mixpanel SDK by following the instructions in this guide.

## [Before you begin](before-you-begin)

To use this feature, you first need to download and set up the Adjust iOS SDK.

## [Guide](guide)

The Mixpanel API enables you to register "super properties." These properties can be sent with all activities. See [Mixpanel's documentation](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking/reference/ios#super-properties) for more information.

To integrate the Adjust SDK with the Mixpanel SDK, you need to register the "super properties."

You should send this information after receiving a response from Adjust's servers. To do this, follow the steps in the attribution callback guide for Android:

-  [Attribution callbacks](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/attribution-callbacks-ios-sdk)

## [Examples](examples)

Modify your callback method to use the Mixpanel API like this:

```objc
- (void)adjustAttributionChanged:(ADJAttribution *)attribution {
    Mixpanel *mixpanel = [Mixpanel sharedInstance];

    // The adjust properties will be sent
    // with all future track calls.
    if (attribution.network != nil)
        [mixpanel registerSuperProperties:@{@"[Adjust]Network":  attribution.network}];
    if (attribution.campaign != nil)
        [mixpanel registerSuperProperties:@{@"[Adjust]Campaign": attribution.campaign}];
    if (attribution.adgroup != nil)
        [mixpanel registerSuperProperties:@{@"[Adjust]Adgroup":  attribution.adgroup}];
    if (attribution.creative != nil)
        [mixpanel registerSuperProperties:@{@"[Adjust]Creative": attribution.creative}];
}
```
