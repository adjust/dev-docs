The following steps only set up subscription tracking within the Adjust SDK. To enable the feature, Adjust need to set up app-specific information. Contact support@adjust.com or talk to your Technical Account manager to set this up.

You can record App Store subscriptions and verify their validity with the Adjust SDK. After the user purchases a subscription, create an `ADJSubscription` instance containing the details.

## 1. Set up your subscription object

To get started, you need to create a subscription object containing details of the subscription purchase. To do this, initialize an `ADJSubscription` object using the [`initWithPrice` method](#ios-initwithprice-invocation).

<InitWithPrice />

### Record the purchase date

You can record the date on which the user purchased a subscription. The SDK returns this data for you to report on. Call the [`setTransactionDate` method](#ios-settransactiondate-invocation) with a timestamp to record this information.

<SetTransactionDate />

### Record the purchase region

You can record the region in which the user purchased a subscription. To do this, call the [`setSalesRegion` method](#ios-setsalesregion-invocation) on your subscription object and pass the country code as a **string**. This needs to be formatted as the [`countryCode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale/1643060-countrycode?language=swift) of the [`priceLocale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproduct/1506145-pricelocale?language=swift) object.

<SetSalesRegion />

### Add callback parameters

You can add callback parameters to your subscription object. The SDK appends these parameters to your callback URL. To add callback parameters, call the [`addCallbackParameter` method](#ios-adjsubscription-addcallbackparameter-invocation) on your subscription object. You can add multiple callback parameters by calling this method multiple times.

<AddCallbackParameter />

### Add partner parameters

You can add partner parameters to your subscription object. The SDK sends these to Adjust's servers when the user purchases a subscription. Adjust's servers forward the information on to your network partner. To add partner parameters, call the [`addPartnerParameter` method](#ios-adjsubscription-addpartnerparameter-invocation) on your subscription object. You can add multiple partner parameters by calling this method multiple times.

<AddPartnerParameter />

## 2. Send subscription information

Once you have set up your subscription object, you can send it to Adjust using the Adjust SDK. Pass your completed object to the [`trackSubscription` method](#ios-tracksubscription-invocation) to record the user's subscription purchase.

<TrackSubscription />
