You can use the Adjust SDK to record activity from apps that came preinstalled on a user's device. This enables you to send information from users who didn't download your app from a campaign.

Configuring a default campaign enables you to attribute all preinstalls to a predefined campaign token. Adjust records all information against this token until the attribution source changes. To set this up:

1. Create a new link in Adjust.
   
```http "{token}"
https://app.adjust.com/{token}
```

2. Copy this token and pass it to the <Tooltip>`setDefaultTracker` method || <SetDefaultTrackerSig /></Tooltip> in your app delegate file.

<SetDefaultTracker />

3. Build and run your app. If you have logging enabled, you should see a message in your log

```text
Default tracker: 'abc123'.
```
