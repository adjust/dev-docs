You need to configure your app in the Adjust dashboard to enable deep linking. To do this, make sure you have done the following:

-  [ ] Added your app in the Adjust dashboard.
-  [ ] Retrieved all the required deep linking data.

## Set up universal links in your app

To enable deep linking support for iOS 9 and later you need to set up universal links in Adjust.

<Callout type="note">

You can enter only one Bundle ID per app. If you are testing an app with a Debug Bundle ID, you need to create a separate app.

</Callout>

Once you have gathered your setup data, you can add this to your app in Adjust. Adding the information to your app enables you to add deep links to your campaigns. To set up universal links, follow these steps:

1. Go to <GuiLabel>AppView</GuiLabel>.
2. On the <GuiLabel>Platforms</GuiLabel> tab, select <MenuSelection>Add platform --> iOS: Apple App Store</MenuSelection>.
3. Enter your App ID.
   * If you haven't submitted your app to the App Store yet, select <GuiLabel>I don't have an app ID yet</GuiLabel>.
4. Select <GuiLabel>Request Verification</GuiLabel> only if you have entered the app ID. You need to verify the app ID to use Adjust's SKAdNetwork solution for your app.
5. Enter the <GuiLabel>iOS bundle ID</GuiLabel> of your app.
6. Under <GuiLabel>Device type</GuiLabel>, choose your app's default device:
   * Universal - iPhone and iPad
   * iPhone
   * iPad
7. (Optional) Under <GuiLabel>Universal linking</GuiLabel>, turn on Enable universal linking to enable universal links for your app.
   * Enter the <GuiLabel>App ID prefix</GuiLabel>.
   * Enter the <GuiLabel>App scheme</GuiLabel>.
8. (Optional) Turn on <GuiLabel>Redirect all clicks to a custom URL</GuiLabel> and enter a <GuiLabel>Custom URL</GuiLabel>, if you want your users to go to a custom website instead of the App Store. This is recommended if your app doesn't have an App ID.
9. (Optional) Turn on <GuiLabel>Send data to App Store Connect</GuiLabel> and enter the <GuiLabel>Apple provider ID</GuiLabel> to send data to App Store Connect App Analytics.
10. Select <GuiLabel>Save</GuiLabel>.

## Set up deep links with a custom URL scheme

In this case, you need to pick a custom URL scheme name which your app will be responsible for opening. You can then use this scheme name in the Adjust tracker URL as part of the deep link parameter.

To create a deep link with a custom URL scheme, follow these steps:

1. Define the format of your custom URL scheme. If you are using a cross-platform framework, refer to the documentation for that framework to define the format of your custom URL scheme. Example: `example://summer-clothes?promo=beach`
2. URL encode the deep link. Example: `example%3A%2F%2Fsummer-clothes%3Fpromo%3Dbeach`
3. Pass this encoded deep link into an Adjust tracker URL. Example: `https://app.adjust.com/abc123?deeplink=%3A%2F%2Fsummer-clothes%3Fpromo%3Dbeach`
4. Append the `deeplink_js=1` parameter to the tracker URL with the encoded deep link. This forces the Adjust system to use the iOS custom URL scheme. Example: `https://app.adjust.com/abc123?deeplink_js=1&deeplink=%3A%2F%2Fsummer-clothes%3Fpromo%3Dbeach`
