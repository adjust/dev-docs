Below are additional deep link features for specific use cases.

## Direct deep linking

### Handling Deeplinks with Referrer {#handling-deeplinks-with-referrer}

An optional referrer URL used to track source of the deep link or app open for better attribution or reattribution and deep linking. For example, channels like SEO / Organic Search, Adjust links are not directly used. If the client's root domain has Universal Links implemented and triggers an app opening, For such channels, we may have to rely on signals coming from the referrer URL to attribute or reattribute users.

#### Set up a Referrer URL

          // and to get the URL resolved if it’s a shortened one.

## Deferred deep linking

### Set up Adjust LinkMe {#set-up-adjust-linkme}

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```objc
- (void)enableLinkMe;
```

</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="note">

Discuss with your marketing team whether you need to implement LinkMe in your app.

</Callout>

[Adjust’s LinkMe solution](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/linkme) is an optional feature that ensures robust deferred deep linking performance by enabling your app to read deep link information from the device pasteboard.

<Callout type="important">

The Adjust SDK checks the pasteboard when a user opens the app for the first time. The device displays a dialog asking if the user wants to allow the app to read the pasteboard.

</Callout>

When a user clicks on a LinkMe URL they have the option to copy the link information to their system pasteboard. You can use the Adjust SDK to read the system pasteboard for deep link information. If deep link information is present, the Adjust SDK forwards the user to the correct page in your app.

To enable pasteboard checking in your app, call the `[ADJConfig enableLinkMe]` method.
