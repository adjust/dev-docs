When a user with your app installed clicks an Adjust link, direct deep linking ensures they're taken directly to specific content within the app.

## Setup {#setup}

iOS provides several methods for receiving direct deep links depending on your app's implementation.

Within these methods, you'll use Adjust's `processAndResolve(_:withCompletionHandler:)` method, which does the following:

- Records attribution from deep link clicks
- Resolves [short branded links](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/short-branded-links) to their long branded link equivalent
- Passes through all other links as is (Adjust long branded links, other universal links, app scheme deep links)

Your app can then handle the resolved link by parsing it and navigating to the appropriate screen.

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">
   
```objc 
+ (void)processAndResolveDeeplink:(nonnull ADJDeeplink *)deeplink
            withCompletionHandler:(nonnull ADJResolvedDeeplinkBlock)completion;
```

</CodeBlock>

## Important Implementation Notes {#important-implementation-notes}

Follow these deep link handling best practices:

1. **Link Handling Requirements**

   - Your app should handle Adjust branded links (`brandname.go.link`) and your universal links (`example.com`) identically. If your app uses a domain allowlist, ensure your Adjust branded domain is included. For example, both of the following should navigate to the same screen:

      - Adjust branded link: `https://brandname.go.link/summer-clothes?promo=beach`
      - Universal link: `https://example.com/summer-clothes?promo=beach`

   - Your app should handle Adjust branded links and app scheme deep links identically. In cases where iOS doesn't support universal links, Adjust converts them to the equivalent app scheme format. For example, both of the following should navigate to the same screen:
      - Adjust branded link: `https://brandname.go.link/summer-clothes?promo=beach`
      - App scheme deep link: `example://summer-clothes?promo=beach`

2. **App State Considerations**

   - Ensure your app correctly handles links when they open the app from any state: "not running," background, or, if applicable, foreground.
   - Consider storing deep links if they can't be handled immediately, such as when the user isn't yet authenticated, and process them once the app is ready for navigation.

3. **In-App Navigation**
   - When an app tries to open its own universal links by calling `UIApplication.open(_:options:completionHandler:)` or SwiftUIâ€™s `openURL`, iOS opens them in Safari instead of the app. To use these methods for internal navigation, you can only pass app scheme deep links to them. Alternatively, you can place universal links within your app and use your deep link handling logic to parse them and navigate to the appropriate screen.

## Implementation {#implementation}

Use the implementation that aligns with your app's structure:

- [UIKit apps using AppDelegate lifecycle](#uikit-apps-using-appdelegate-lifecycle)
- [UIKit apps using SceneDelegate lifecycle](#uikit-apps-using-scenedelegate-lifecycle)
- [SwiftUI apps using AppDelegate lifecycle](#swiftui-apps-using-appdelegate-lifecycle)
- [SwiftUI apps using SceneDelegate lifecycle](#swiftui-apps-using-scenedelegate-lifecycle)

#### Custom URL scheme {#custom-url-scheme-2}

1. Update the `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` method in your scene delegate. When a user clicks on your custom URL scheme deep link and the user has your app closed, iOS opens your app and delivers the deep link to this method.
2. Update the `scene(_:openURLContexts:)` method in your scene delegate. When a user clicks on your custom URL scheme deep link, and the user has your app running in the background, iOS opens your app and delivers the deep link to this method.

These methods call the `Adjust.processDeeplink` method in the Adjust SDK. This method sends deep links to Adjust's servers to recordd them. You can pass both Adjust and non-Adjust deep links to this method. Adjust's servers ignore any deep links that donâ€™t have Adjust parameters.

### SwiftUI apps using SceneDelegate lifecycle {#swiftui-apps-using-scenedelegate-lifecycle}

Follow the instructions in the [SwiftUI apps using AppDelegate lifecycle](#swiftui-apps-using-appdelegate-lifecycle) section. The `onOpenURL` SwiftUI modifier receives universal links and app scheme deep links when the app is installed and the link opens the app from a background or foreground state.

In addition, implement the `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` method from the [UIKit apps using SceneDelegate lifecycle](#uikit-apps-using-scenedelegate-lifecycle) section. This method receives universal links and app scheme deep links when the app is installed and the link opens the app from a "not running" state.

### SwiftUI apps using AppDelegate lifecycle {#swiftui-apps-using-appdelegate-lifecycle}

If you haven't already done so, create an `AppDelegate.swift` file in your project's main directory and reference it in your main application file, as shown in the example `App.swift` file below. This is required to handle app lifecycle events and Adjust SDK integration. Also, implement the `onOpenURL` SwiftUI modifier, which receives universal links and app scheme deep links when the app is installed.
