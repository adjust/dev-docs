If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you can use the Adjust SDK to request purchase verification.

<Callout type="important">

To use Purchase verification, you first need to set up your app for purchase verification in the Adjust suite. See [Set up purchase verification for your app](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/set-up-purchase-verification-for-your-app) for instructions.

</Callout>

There are two ways to verify purchases with the Adjust SDK:

1. Create an `ADJEvent` object that represents your purchase and add the following properties:
   - `transactionId` (`NSString`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
   - `productId` (`NSString`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
2. Create an `ADJAppStorePurchase` object with your transaction ID and product ID.

<Callout type="tip">

If you use revenue events to measure your purchases in Adjust, you should use the `ADJEvent` class. If you only want to verify a purchase but don't want to associate it with an event, use the `ADJAppStorePurchase` class.

</Callout>

When you send purchase information with the Adjust SDK, Adjust does the following:

1. Sends the information to the App Store and waits for a status response.
2. Forwards the status response to the Adjust SDK.

You can access the purchase verification status by using a callback. Results are returned as `ADJPurchaseVerificationResult` objects containing the following properties:

- `verificationStatus` (`NSString`): The status of the purchase.
- `code` (`int`): The status code of the purchase.
- `message` (`NSString`): Any message returned by the App Store.

## Record event and verify purchase {#record-event-and-verify-purchase}

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```objc
- (void)verifyAndTrackAppStorePurchase:(nonnull ADJEvent *)event
                 withCompletionHandler:(nonnull ADJVerificationResultBlock)completion;
```

</CodeBlock>

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `ADJEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   - `transactionId` (`NSString`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
   - `productId` (`NSString`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   - `event` (`ADJEvent`): Your instantiated event object.
   - `callback` (`ADJVerificationResultBlock`): A delegate callback function that receives an `ADJPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

## Only verify purchase {#only-verify-purchase}

To send a standalone purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `ADJAppStorePurchase` with the following arguments:
   - `transactionId` (`NSString`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
   - `productId` (`NSString`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAppStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   - `purchase` (`ADJAppStorePurchase`): Your instantiated purchase object.
   - `callback` (`ADJVerificationResultBlock`): A delegate callback function that receives an `ADJPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.
