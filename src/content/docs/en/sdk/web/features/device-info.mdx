The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.

## Web UUID {#web-uuid}

<MinorVersion

/>

To identify web users in Adjust, Web SDK generates a unique `web_uuid` when it sends the first session. The `waitForWebUUID` method returns a **Promise** that resolves once the `web_uuid` has been generated or retrieved from browser storage (using IndexedDB or LocalStorage, based on availability). The identifier follows the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) format.

Call the `waitForWebUUID` method to return this information as a `string`.

```js
Adjust.waitForWebUUID().then((webUuid) => console.log(webUuid));
```
