The Adjust SDK contains features that you can use to handle user privacy in your app.

## Send erasure request {#send-erasure-request}

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```js
function gdprForgetMe(): void;
```

</CodeBlock>

The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar privacy laws worldwide (CCPA, LGPD, etc.) grant data subjects comprehensive rights when it comes to the processing of their personal data. These rights include, among others, the right to erasure (see [Art. 17 GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/article-17-right-to-be-forgotten/))([1](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/gdpr#ref-1)). As a data processor, Adjust is obliged to support you (the data controller) in the processing of such requests from your (app) users.

You can send the user's erasure request to Adjust by calling the `gdprForgetMe` method. Once Adjust has been notified:

-  Adjust will permanently delete all of the user’s historical personal data from its internal systems and database.
-  Adjust will no longer receive data from this user/device via the Adjust SDK.([2](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/gdpr#ref-2))

```js
Adjust.gdprForgetMe();
```

## Third-party sharing for specific users {#third-party-sharing-for-specific-users}

<MinorVersion
   added="5.7.0"
   link="https://github.com/adjust/web_sdk/releases/tag/v5.7.0"
/>

You can use the Adjust SDK to record when a user changes their third-party sharing settings. Third party sharing settings are configured using the `ThirdPartySharing` class.

### Instantiate an AdjustThirdPartySharing object {#instantiate-an-adjustthirdpartysharing-object}

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```ts
class ThirdPartySharing {
   constructor(isEnabled: boolean) {}
   // ...
}
```

</CodeBlock>

To enable or disable third party sharing with the Adjust SDK, you need to instantiate an `ThirdPartySharing` object. This object contains variables that control how third party sharing is handled by Adjust.

To instantiate a third party sharing object, create a new ` ThirdPartySharing` instance and pass the following parameters:

-  `isEnabled` (`Boolean`): Whether third party sharing is enabled. Pass `true` to enable third party sharing or `false` to disable third party sharing

```ts
const adjustThirdPartySharing = new Adjust.ThirdPartySharing(true);
```

<Callout type="note">

If you set the `isEnabled` property to `false`, Adjust stops sharing the user's data with third parties. The Adjust SDK continues to work as expected.

</Callout>

Once you've instantiated your `ThirdPartySharing` object, you can send the information to Adjust by calling the `Adjust.trackThirdPartySharing` method with your `ThirdPartySharing` instance as an argument.

```ts
const adjustThirdPartySharing = new Adjust.ThirdPartySharing(true);
Adjust.trackThirdPartySharing(adjustThirdPartySharing);
```

### Disable third-party sharing (Deprecated) {#disable-third-party-sharing}

<MinorVersion
   removed="5.7.0"
   link="https://github.com/adjust/web_sdk/releases/tag/v5.7.0"
/>

To disable third party sharing in previous versions of the SDK, you needed to call the `disableThirdPartySharing` method. This method is now deprecated. If you are still using it, note that it calls the underlying method directly.

```ts
const adjustThirdPartySharing = new Adjust.ThirdPartySharing(false);
Adjust.trackThirdPartySharing(adjustThirdPartySharing);
```

### Send granular information {#send-granular-information}

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```ts
public addGranularOption(partnerName: string,
                         key: string,
                         value: string)
```

</CodeBlock>

You can attach granular information when a user updates their third-party sharing preferences. Use this information to communicate more detail about a user's decision. To do this, call the `addGranularOption` method with the following parameters:

-  `partnerName` (`string`): The name of the partner for whom the granular option applies.
-  `key` (`string`): The option key.
-  `value` (`string`): The option value.

```ts
const adjustThirdPartySharing = new Adjust.ThirdPartySharing(true);
options.addGranularOption("PartnerA", "foo", "bar");
Adjust.trackThirdPartySharing(options);
```

## URL strategy {#url-strategy}

<MinorVersion
   changed="5.7.0"
   link="https://github.com/adjust/web_sdk/releases/tag/v5.7.0"
/>

The URL strategy feature allows you to set either:

-  The country in which Adjust stores your data (data residency).
-  The endpoint to which the Adjust SDK sends traffic (URL strategy).

This is useful if you're operating in a country with strict privacy requirements. When you set your URL strategy, Adjust stores data in the selected data residency region or sends traffic to the chosen domain.

To set your country of data residency, call the `AdjustConfig.setUrlStrategy` method following parameters:

-  `domains` (`Array<string>`): The country or countries of data residence, or the endpoints to which you want to send SDK traffic. By default, the Adjust SDK sends all data to Adjust's endpoints. If you want to specify a custom endpoint, pass your endpoint in the `domains` property of `urlStrategy`.
-  `useSubdomains` (`boolean`): Whether the domain should be treated as an Adjust domain. If `true`, the SDK will prefix the domains with Adjust-specific subdomains. If `false`, the SDK will use the provided domain as-is, without adding any prefixes.
-  `isDataResidency` (`boolean`): Optional. Whether the domain should be used for data residency.

See the table below for a list of mappings.

| URL strategy        | Main and fallback domain      | Use sub domains | Is Data Residency |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| EU data residency   | `'eu.adjust.com'`             | `true`          | `true`            |
| China URL strategy  | `'adjust.cn'`, `'adjust.com'` | `true`          | `false`           |
| Custom URL strategy | `'my.custom.domain'`          | `false`         | `false`           |

```js
Adjust.initSdk({
   appToken: "YOUR_APP_TOKEN",
   environment: "production",
   logLevel: "verbose",
   urlStrategy: {
      domains: ["adjust.cn", "adjust.com"],
      useSubdomains: true,
      isDataResidency: false,
   },
});
```

### Set custom endpoint {#set-custom-endpoint}

<MinorVersion
   removed="5.7.0"
   link="https://github.com/adjust/web_sdk/releases/tag/v5.7.0"
/>

In previous versions of the SDK, you needed to pass your endpoint in the `customUrl` property of the `initSdk` method. However, it is now deprecated. To set data residency in the current SDK, use the `urlStrategy` configuration instead.

<CodeBlock del="{range: 5}" ins="{range: 6-10}">

```js
Adjust.initSdk({
   appToken: "YOUR_APP_TOKEN",
   environment: "production",
   logLevel: "verbose",
   customUrl: "my.custom.domain.com",
   urlStrategy: {
      domains: ["my.custom.domain"],
      useSubdomains: true,
      isDataResidency: false,
   },
});
```

</CodeBlock>

### Data residency (Deprecated) {#data-residency}

<MinorVersion
   removed="5.7.0"
   link="https://github.com/adjust/web_sdk/releases/tag/v5.7.0"
/>

In previous versions of the SDK, this feature was used to configure data residency. However, it is now deprecated. To set data residency in the current SDK, use the `urlStrategy` configuration instead.

<CodeBlock del="{range: 5}" ins="{range: 6-10}">

```js
Adjust.initSdk({
   appToken: "YOUR_APP_TOKEN",
   environment: "production",
   logLevel: "verbose",
   dataResidency: "EU",
   urlStrategy: {
      domains: ["adjust.cn", "adjust.com"],
      useSubdomains: true,
      isDataResidency: false,
   },
});
```

</CodeBlock>
