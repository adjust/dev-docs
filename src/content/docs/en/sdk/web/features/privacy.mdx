The Adjust SDK contains features that you can use to handle user privacy in your app.

## Send erasure request {#send-erasure-request}

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```js
function gdprForgetMe(): void;
```

</CodeBlock>

The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar privacy laws worldwide (CCPA, LGPD, etc.) grant data subjects comprehensive rights when it comes to the processing of their personal data. These rights include, among others, the right to erasure (see [Art. 17 GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/article-17-right-to-be-forgotten/))([1](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/gdpr#ref-1)). As a data processor, Adjust is obliged to support you (the data controller) in the processing of such requests from your (app) users.

You can send the user's erasure request to Adjust by calling the `gdprForgetMe` method. Once Adjust has been notified:

-  Adjust will permanently delete all of the user’s historical personal data from its internal systems and database.
-  Adjust will no longer receive data from this user/device via the Adjust SDK.([2](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/gdpr#ref-2))

```js
Adjust.gdprForgetMe();
```

## Disable third-party sharing {#disable-third-party-sharing}

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```js
function disableThirdPartySharing(): void;
```

</CodeBlock>

To disable third-party sharing for all users, call the `disableThirdPartySharing` method. When Adjust's servers receive this information, Adjust stops sharing the user's data with third parties. The Adjust SDK continues to work as expected.

```js
Adjust.disableThirdPartySharing();
```

## Data residency {#data-residency}

<CodeBlock title="Property declaration">

```js
dataResidency: "EU" | "TR" | "US";
```

</CodeBlock>

The data residency feature allows you to choose the country in which Adjust stores your data. This is useful if you're operating in a country with strict privacy requirements. When you set up data residency, Adjust stores your data in a data center located in the region your have chosen.

To set your country of data residency, pass the region code of your preferred country code in the `dataResidency` property of the `initSdk` method.

| Region                   | Code |
| ------------------------ | ---- |
| European Union           | `EU` |
| Turkey                   | `TR` |
| United States of America | `US` |

```js
Adjust.initSdk({
   appToken: "YOUR_APP_TOKEN",
   environment: "production",
   logLevel: "verbose",
   dataResidency: "EU",
});
```

## URL strategy {#url-strategy}

<CodeBlock title="Property declaration">

```js
urlStrategy: "india" | "china";
```

</CodeBlock>

You can set a URL strategy to prioritize regional endpoints for sending data from the Adjust SDK. To do this, pass the region of your preferred country code in the `urlStrategy` property of the `initSdk` method.

| Region | Code    |
| ------ | ------- |
| China  | `china` |
| India  | `india` |

```js
Adjust.initSdk({
   appToken: "YOUR_APP_TOKEN",
   environment: "production",
   logLevel: "verbose",
   urlStrategy: "china",
});
```

## Set custom endpoint {#set-custom-endpoint}

<CodeBlock title="Property declaration">

```js
customUrl: string;
```

</CodeBlock>

By default, the Adjust SDK sends all data to Adjust's endpoints. If you want to specify a custom endpoint, pass your endpoint in the `customUrl` property of the `initSdk` method.

```js
Adjust.initSdk({
   appToken: "YOUR_APP_TOKEN",
   environment: "sandbox",
   customUrl: "https://my-custom-url.com/",
});
```
