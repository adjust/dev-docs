import SetReferrer from "@web-examples/Adjust/setReferrer.mdx"

You can set a referrer to trigger an SDK click with a custom click ID when the SDK starts. The SDK sends your custom click ID to Adjust's servers for attribution purposes.

<Callout type="important">

Call this method as close to initializing the SDK as possible to ensure your referrer is used for attribution.

</Callout>

To set your referrer, call the [`setReferrer` method](#web-setreferrer-invocation) and pass your referrer as a URL-encoded **string** argument.
