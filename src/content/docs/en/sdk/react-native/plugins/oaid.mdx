The <Abbr>OAID (Open Anonymous Device Identifier)</Abbr> is a unique identifier for Android devices. The <Abbr>MSA (Mobile Security Alliance)</Abbr> recommends all Chinese-manufactured devices provide an OAID. You can use the OAID to attribute and track devices where Google Play Services isn't available.

The OAID plugin provides the OAID of a device. The SDK will continue to use other identifiers as well as the OAID.

## Add the plugin to your app

<Callout type="note">

You need to load the Adjust OAID Prefab **before** the Adjust Prefab. This ensures the plugin reads the instructions before the SDK initializes.

</Callout>

The Adjust OAID plugin for React Native is available from npm.

```console title="npm"
$ npm install react-native-adjust-oaid --save
```

## Use the plugin

Once you have set up the plugin, you can gather the device's OAID. To do this, call the `AdjustOaid.ReadOaid` method before starting the Adjust SDK.

```jsx {2}
import { AdjustOaid } from 'react-native-adjust-oaid';
AdjustOaid.readOaid();
// ...
Adjust.create(adjustConfig);
```

To stop the SDK from reading OAID values, call the `AdjustOaid.doNotReadOaid()` method.

```jsx
AdjustOaid.readOaid();
```
