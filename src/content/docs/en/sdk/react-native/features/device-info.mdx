The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.

## [Adjust device identifier](adjust-device-identifier)

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```ts
getAdid: (callback: (adid: string) => void) => void
```

</CodeBlock>

Adjust generates a unique Adjust Device ID (ADID) for each device. Call the `getAdid` method to return this ID as a `string`.

```jsx
Adjust.getAdid((adid) => {
   console.log("ADID = " + adid);
});
```

## [ID For Advertisers](id-for-advertisers)

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```ts
getIdfa: (callback: (idfa: string) => void) => void
```

</CodeBlock>

The ID for Advertisers (IDFA) is a device-specific identifier for Apple devices. Call the `getIdfa` method to return this ID as a `string`.

```jsx
Adjust.getIdfa((idfa) => {
   console.log("IDFA = " + idfa);
});
```

## [Google Play Services Advertising ID](google-play-services-advertising-id)

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```ts
getGoogleAdId: (callback: (adid: string) => void) => void
```

</CodeBlock>

The Google Play Services Advertising ID (GPS ADID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices.

Users can opt out of sharing their GPS ADID by toggling the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting on their device. When a user enables this setting, the Adjust SDK returns a string of zeros when trying to read the GPS ADID.

You can access this value by calling the `getGoogleAdId` method in a background thread. Assign a delegate function to access the GPS ADID value.

```jsx
Adjust.getGoogleAdId((googleAdId) => {
   console.log("Google Ad ID = " + googleAdId);
});
```

## [Amazon Advertiser ID](amazon-advertiser-id)

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```ts
getAmazonAdId: (callback: (adid: string) => void) => void
```

</CodeBlock>

The Amazon Advertising ID (Amazon Ad ID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices. Call the `getAmazonAdId` method to return this ID as a `string`.

```jsx
Adjust.getAmazonAdId((amazonAdId) => {
   console.log("Amazon Ad ID = " + amazonAdId);
});
```
