If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you can use the Adjust SDK to request purchase verification. There are two ways to verify purchases with the Adjust SDK:

1. Create an `AdjustEvent` object that represents your purchase and configure purchase properties for the target store.
2. Create an `AdjustAppStorePurchase` (Apple App Store) or `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` (Google Play Store) object representing the purchase.

<Callout type="tip">

If you use revenue events to measure your purchases in Adjust, you should use the `AdjustEvent` class. If you only want to verify a purchase but don't want to associate it with an event, use the `AdjustAppStorePurchase` or `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` class.

</Callout>

When you send purchase information with the Adjust SDK, Adjust does the following:

1. Sends the information to the relevant store and waits for a status response.
2. Forwards the status response to the Adjust SDK.

You can access the purchase verification status by using a callback. Results are returned as `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` objects containing the following properties:

- `verificationStatus` (`string`): The status of the purchase.
- `code` (`number`): The status code of the purchase.
- `message` (`string`): Any message returned by the store.

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```js
verifyAndTrackAppStorePurchase: (adjustEvent: AdjustEvent, callback: (verificationResult: AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult) => void) => void
```

</CodeBlock>

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   - `ProductId` (`string`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   - `TransactionId` (`string`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   - `adjustEvent` (`AdjustEvent`): Your instantiated event object.
   - `callback` (`function`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```js
var adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.setProductId("product-id");
adjustEvent.setTransactionId("transaction-id");
adjustEvent.setRevenue(6.66, "CAD");
Adjust.verifyAndTrackAppStorePurchase(adjustEvent, (verificationResult) => {
   console.log(`Verification status: ${verificationResult.verificationStatus}`);
   console.log(`Code: ${verificationResult.code}`);
   console.log(`Message: ${verificationResult.message}`);
});

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   - `productId` (`string`): The ID of the product that has been purchased.
   - `purchaseToken` (`string`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   - `adjustEvent` (`AdjustEvent`): Your instantiated event object.
   - `callback` (`function`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```js
var adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.setProductId("product-id");
adjustEvent.setPurchaseToken("purchase-token");
adjustEvent.setRevenue(6.66, "CAD");
Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase(adjustEvent, (verificationResult) => {
   console.log(`Verification status: ${verificationResult.verificationStatus}`);
   console.log(`Code: ${verificationResult.code}`);
   console.log(`Message: ${verificationResult.message}`);

To send a standalone App Store purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustAppStorePurchase` object with the following arguments:
   - `productId` (`string`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   - `transactionId` (`string`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAppStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   - `purchase` (`AdjustAppStorePurchase`): Your instantiated event object.
   - `callback` (`function`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```js
var purchase = new AdjustAppStorePurchase("product-id", "transaction-id");
Adjust.verifyAppStorePurchase(purchase, (verificationResult) => {
   console.log(`Verification status: ${verificationResult.verificationStatus}`);
   console.log(`Code: ${verificationResult.code}`);
   console.log(`Message: ${verificationResult.message}`);

To send a standalone Play Store purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` with the following arguments:
   - `productId` (`string`): The ID of the product that has been purchased.
   - `purchaseToken` (`string`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   - `purchase` (`AdjustPlayStorePurchase`): Your instantiated purchase object.
   - `verificationResultCallback` (`function`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```js
var purchase = new AdjustPlayStorePurchase("product-id", "purchase-token");
Adjust.verifyPlayStorePurchase(purchase, (verificationResult) => {
   console.log(`Verification status: ${verificationResult.verificationStatus}`);
   console.log(`Code: ${verificationResult.code}`);
   console.log(`Message: ${verificationResult.message}`);
