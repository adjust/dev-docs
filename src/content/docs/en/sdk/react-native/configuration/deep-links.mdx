Deep links are <Abbr>URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)</Abbr> that direct users to a specific page in your app without any additional navigation. You can use them throughout your marketing funnel to improve user acquisition, engagement, and retention.

The Adjust SDK uses different logic depending on whether the user already has your app installed on their device:

Direct deep linking
: Occurs if the user already has your app installed. The link takes the user to the page specified in the link

Deferred deep linking
: Occurs if the user doesn't have your app installed. The link takes the user to a storefront to install your app first. After the user installs the app, it opens to the page specified in the link.

To get started, follow these steps.

## Set up deep linking

If a user has your app installed, it opens when they interact with a link containing deep link information. The Adjust SDK contains tools to parse deep link information for use throughout your app.

To set up deep linking on your React Native app:

1. Set up deep linking on an app level. Follow the instructions linked below to set up deep linking on your target platform:
   - [iOS](/en/sdk/ios/configuration/deep-links)
   - [Android](/en/sdk/android/configuration/deep-links)
2. Refer to the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking.html) and follow the instructions to learn how to support both platforms.
3. Use your obtained deep link URL in your JavaScript code.

## Deferred deep linking

### Disable deferred deep linking

The SDK opens deferred deep links by default. You can configure this by passing a **boolean** argument to the <Tooltip>`setLaunchDeferredDeeplink` method || <SetShouldLaunchDeeplinkSig /></Tooltip>.

<SetShouldLaunchDeeplink />

### Set up a deferred deep link delegate

You can configure the Adjust SDK to call a delegate function when it receives a deferred deep link by calling the <Tooltip>`SetDeferredDeeplinkCallbackListener` method || <SetDeferredDeeplinkCallbackListenerSig /></Tooltip>. This delegate function receives the deep link as a **string** argument.

<SetDeferredDeeplinkCallbackListener />

### Example

This example demonstrates how to log a deep link address when the user opens a deferred deep link.

```jsx {1-3, 9}
const LogDeepLink = function (deeplinkURL) {
   console.log("Deeplink URL: " + deeplinkURL);
};
//...
const adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(
   "{YourAppToken}",
   AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox
);
adjustConfig.setDeferredDeeplinkCallbackListener(LogDeepLink);
//...
Adjust.create(adjustConfig);
```

### Enable LinkMe

The Adjust SDK lets you copy deep link information from the device pasteboard. When combined with Adjustâ€™s LinkMe solution, this feature enables deferred deep linking on devices running iOS 15 and above.

<Callout type="important">

The Adjust SDK checks the pasteboard when a user opens the app for the first time. The device displays a dialog asking if the user wants to allow the app to read the pasteboard.

</Callout>

When a user clicks on a LinkMe URL they have the option to copy the link information to their system pasteboard. You can use the Adjust SDK to read the system pasteboard for deep link information. If deep link information is present, the SDK forwards the user to the correct page in your app.

To enable pasteboard checking in your app, pass a true value to the <Tooltip>`setLinkMeEnabled` method || <SetLinkMeEnabledSig /></Tooltip> on your config object:

<SetLinkMeEnabled />
