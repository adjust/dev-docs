You can use the Adjust SDK to record activity from apps that came preinstalled on a user's device. This enables you to send information from users who didn't download your app from a campaign.

## [Default link token](default-link-token)

Configuring a default link token enables you to attribute all preinstalls to a predefined Adjust link. Adjust records all information against this token until the attribution source changes. To set this up:

1. [Create a new campaign link in Campaign Lab](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/links).

   ```text
   https://app.adjust.com/{token}
   ```

2. Copy this token and assign it to the [`defaultTracker` property](/en/sdk/flutter/configuration#set-default-link-token) of your config object.

   <CodeBlock highlight="{range: 3}">

   ```cs
   var config = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment,
      msg => System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(msg), LogLevel.Verbose);
   config.DefaultTracker = "{TrackerToken}";
   Adjust.ApplicationLaunching(config);
   ```

   </CodeBlock>

3. Build and run your app. If you have logging enabled, you should see a message in your log

   ```text
   Default tracker: 'abc123'.
   ```
