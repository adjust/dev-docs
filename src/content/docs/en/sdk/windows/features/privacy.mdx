The Adjust SDK contains features that you can use to handle user privacy in your app.

## Send erasure request {#send-erasure-request}

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cs
public static void GdprForgetMe();
```

</CodeBlock>

The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar privacy laws worldwide (CCPA, LGPD, etc.) grant data subjects comprehensive rights when it comes to the processing of their personal data. These rights include, among others, the right to erasure (see [Art. 17 GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/article-17-right-to-be-forgotten/))([1](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/gdpr#ref-1)). As a data processor, Adjust is obliged to support you (the data controller) in the processing of such requests from your (app) users.

You can send the user's erasure request to Adjust by calling the `gdprForgetMe` method. Once Adjust has been notified:

-  Adjust will permanently delete all of the user’s historical personal data from its internal systems and database.
-  Adjust will no longer receive data from this user/device via the Adjust SDK.([2](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/gdpr#ref-2))

```cs
Adjust.GdprForgetMe();
```
