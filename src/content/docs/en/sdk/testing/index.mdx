Once you've set up the Adjust SDK in your app, you should test it to make sure everything is working. Adjust provides a testing console you can use to see information passed from your test device to Adjust's servers.

You can use the following tools to test the Adjust SDK:

-  The Adjust testing console, available in [AppView](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/testing-console).
-  The [Adjust Device API](/en/api/device-api).
-  Your IDE's log output.

The guides in this section show you how to test various features and scenarios so you can be sure your integration works as expected.

1. Test that the SDK is [sending install information to Adjust](/en/sdk/testing/install-recording).
2. Test that the SDK is [sending your in-app events to Adjust](/en/sdk/testing/event-recording).
3. Test that the SDK is [sending your subscription information to Adjust](/en/sdk/testing/subscription-recording).
4. Test that you've integrated the Adjust SDK signature correctly for your platform.
