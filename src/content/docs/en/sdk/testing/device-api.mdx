The [Device API](/en/api/device-api/) allows you to verify install information without logging in to the Adjust dashboard. You can use the [inspect device endpoint](en/api/device-api/inspect/) to inspect the following information:

-  Device attribution
-  Device reattribution
-  Event data
-  Push token integration
-  Subscription data

To use the Device API:

1. Follow the integration guide for your platform to integrate the Adjust SDK.
2. Set the environment to **sandbox**. This ensures that your app only sends information to the testing console.
3. Set your log level to **verbose** to capture all logging information from your app.
4. Set up a test device or an emulated device and find the device's advertising ID. You can install the [Adjust Insights app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adjust-insights/id1125517808) to find this information.
5. If you've previously used the device for testing:

   1. Delete your app from the test device.
   2. Clear the device's advertising ID from the testing console. Follow the instructions for the [Testing console in AppView](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/testing-console#forget-device).
   3. Alternatively, call the [forget device endpoint](/en/api/device-api/forget/) to remove existing information about the device.

   ```bash
   curl --location --request POST "https://api.adjust.com/device_service/api/v1/forget_device" \
   --header "Authorization: Token token={your_token}" \
   --data "adid={your_device_id}&app_token={your_app_token}"
   ```

6. Download and open the test version of your app that contains the Adjust SDK.
7. Call the [inspect device endpoint](/en/api/device-api/inspect/) to return install information about the device.

   ```bash
   curl --location --request GET "https://api.adjust.com/device_service/api/v1/inspect_device?advertising_id={your_advertising_id}&app_token={your_app_token}" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer {your_bearer_token}"
   ```
