You can use the Adjust SDK to record activity from apps that came preinstalled on a user's device. This enables you to send information from users who didn't download your app from a campaign.

## Default link token

Configuring a default link token enables you to attribute all preinstalls to a predefined Adjust link. Adjust records all information against this token until the attribution source changes. To set this up:

1. [Create a new campaign link in Campaign Lab](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/links).

   ```text "{token}"
   https://app.adjust.com/{token}
   ```

2. Copy this token and pass it as an argument to the `setDefaultTracker` method of your config object.

   ```js {2}
   var adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);
   adjustConfig.setDefaultTracker("{TrackerToken}");
   Adjust.create(adjustConfig);
   ```

3. Build and run your app. If you have logging enabled, you should see a message in your log

   ```text
   Default tracker: 'abc123'.
   ```
