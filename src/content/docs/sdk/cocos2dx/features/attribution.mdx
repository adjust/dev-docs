title: Get attribution information
description: Listen for attribution changes using the Adjust SDK
slug: en/sdk/cocos2dx/features/attribution
---

When a user interacts with an Adjust link, their attribution information updates. This can happen if the user interacts with a [deep link](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/deep-links). Information about a user's attribution is represented in the `AdjustAttribution2dx` class.

## AdjustAttribution2dx class properties

The `AdjustAttribution2dx` class contains details about the current attribution status of the device. Any values that aren't populated for the user are returned as a `null` value.

<Callout type="note">

The following values can only be accessed if the [`needsCost` property on your `AdjustConfig2dx` instance](/en/sdk/cocos2dx/configuration#enable-cost-data-sending) is `true`:

-  `costType`
-  `costAmount`
-  `costCurrency`

</Callout>

## Trigger a function when attribution changes

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cpp
void setAttributionCallback(void(*attributionCallback)(AdjustAttribution2dx attribution));
```

</CodeBlock>

The SDK can listen for attribution changes and call a function when it detects an update. To configure your callback function, call the `setAttributionCallback` method with your function name as an argument.

<Callout type="important">

You must call the `setAttributionCallback` method **before** initializing the Adjust SDK in your app.

</Callout>

```cpp
AdjustConfig2dx adjustConfig = AdjustConfig2dx(appToken, environment);
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel2dxVerbose);
adjustConfig.setAttributionCallback(attributionCallbackMethod);
Adjust2dx::start(adjustConfig);
```

## Get current attribution information

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cpp
static AdjustAttribution2dx getAttribution();
```

</CodeBlock>

When a user installs your app, Adjust attributes the install to a campaign. The Adjust SDK gives you access to campaign attribution details for your install. To return this information, call the `getAttribution` method to return the attribution information as an `AdjustAttribution2dx` object.

```cpp
AdjustAttribution2dx attribution = Adjust2dx::getAttribution();
```
