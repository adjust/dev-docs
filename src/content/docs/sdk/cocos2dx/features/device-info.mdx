The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.

## Adjust device identifier

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cpp
static std::string getAdid();
```

</CodeBlock>

Adjust generates a unique Adjust Device ID (ADID) for each device. Call the `getAdid` method to return this ID as a **string**.

```cpp
std::string adid = Adjust2dx::getAdid();
```

## ID For Advertisers

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cpp
static std::string getIdfa();
```

</CodeBlock>

The ID for Advertisers (IDFA) is a device-specific identifier for Apple devices. Call the `getIdfa` method to return this ID as a **string**.

```cpp
std::string idfa = Adjust2dx::getIdfa();
```

## Google Play Services Advertising ID

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cpp
static void getGoogleAdId(void (*adIdCallback)(std::string adId));
```

</CodeBlock>

The Google Play Services Advertising ID (GPS ADID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices.

Users can opt out of sharing their GPS ADID by toggling the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting on their device. When a user enables this setting, the Adjust SDK returns a string of zeros when trying to read the GPS ADID.

You can access this value by calling the `getGoogleAdId` method in a background thread. Assign a delegate function to access the GPS ADID value.

```cpp
static void adIdCallbackMethod(std::string adId) {
    CCLOG("\nAdvertising identifier = %s", adId.c_str());
    CCLOG("\n");
}

// ...

Adjust2dx::getGoogleAdId(adIdCallbackMethod);
```

## Amazon Advertiser ID

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cpp
static std::string getAmazonAdId();
```

</CodeBlock>

The Amazon Advertising ID (Amazon Ad ID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices. Call the `getAmazonAdId` method to return this ID as a **string**.

```cpp
std::string idfa = Adjust2dx::getAmazonAdId();
```
