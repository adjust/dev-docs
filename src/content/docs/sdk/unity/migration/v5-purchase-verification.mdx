This guide shows you how to migrate from Adjust's Purchase verification SDK to SDK v5's built-in purchase verification features. The SDK v5 purchase verification workflow is a streamlined approach to purchase verification.

With the Purchase Verification SDK, verification is split into three steps:

1. Initialize the Purchase Verification SDK.

   ```cs
   var adjustPVConfig = new ADJPConfig(
       adjustAppToken,
       ADJPEnvironment.Production
   );

   adjustPVConfig.SetLogLevel(ADJPLogLevel.Info);
   new GameObject("AdjustPurchase").AddComponent<AdjustPurchase>();

   AdjustPurchase.Init(adjustPVConfig);
   ```

2. Verify your purchase.

   ```cs
   // purchase verification request on iOS
   AdjustPurchase.VerifyPurchaseiOS("{Receipt}", "{TransactionID}", "{ProductId}", VerificationInfoDelegate);

   // purchase verification request on Android
   AdjustPurchase.VerifyPurchaseAndroid("{ItemSKU}", "{ItemToken}", "{DeveloperPayload}", VerificationInfoDelegate);

   // ...

   private void VerificationInfoDelegate(ADJPVerificationInfo verificationInfo)
   {
       Debug.Log("Verification info callback!");
       Debug.Log("Message: " + verificationInfo.Message);
       Debug.Log("Status code: " + verificationInfo.StatusCode);
       Debug.Log("Verification state: " + verificationInfo.VerificationState);
   }
   ```

3. Depending on the outcome of the verification, configure an `AdjustEvent` object and send it to Adjust.

   ```cs
   AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
   adjustEvent.setRevenue(6.0, "EUR");
   adjustEvent.setProductId("product-id");
   adjustEvent.setTransactionId("transaction-id");
   adjustEvent.setPurchaseToken("purchase-token"); // Android only
   adjustEvent.setReceipt("receipt"); // iOS only
   Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);
   ```

In SDK v5, this workflow is simplified. The `Adjust.verifyAndTrackAppStorePurchase()` and `Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase()` methods allow you to send an event to Adjust's servers and receive the verification status as a callback. Adjust records the event and the verification status automatically.

## [Guide](guide)

Follow the steps in this guide to migrate from the Purchase Verification SDK to SDK v5 built-in purchase verification.

### [1. Uninstall the Purchase Verification SDK](uninstall-the-pv-sdk)

To get started, uninstall the Adjust Purchase Verification SDK.

### [2. Remove Purchase Verification SDK code](remove-pv-sdk-code)

Once you've uninstalled the Adjust Purchase Verification SDK, you must remove all Purchase Verification code from your project.

### [3. Migrate to SDK v5 purchase verification](migrate-to-sdk-v5-pv)

Once you've removed the existing purchase verification code, you can replace it with SDK v5's built-in purchase verification methods. There are two ways to verify purchases with the Adjust SDK:

1. Create an `AdjustEvent` object that represents your purchase and configure purchase properties for the target store.
2. Create an `AdjustAppStorePurchase` (Apple App Store) or `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` (Google Play Store) object representing the purchase.

<Callout type="tip">

If you use revenue events to measure your purchases in Adjust, you should use the `AdjustEvent` class. If you only want to verify a purchase but don't want to associate it with an event, use the `AdjustAppStorePurchase` or `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` class.

#### [Record event and verify purchase](record-event-and-verify-purchase)

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App Store" icon="StoreAppStore" sync="appstore">

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   -  `ProductId` (`string`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   -  `TransactionId` (`string`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
2. Call the `Adjust.VerifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `event` (`AdjustEvent`): Your instantiated event object.
   -  `callback` (`Action`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```cs
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.SetRevenue(6.66, "CAD");
adjustEvent.TransactionId = "transaction-id";
adjustEvent.ProductId = "product-id";
Adjust.VerifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase(adjustEvent, verificationResult =>
{
    Debug.Log("Verification status: " + verificationResult.VerificationStatus);
    Debug.Log("Code: " + verificationResult.Code);
    Debug.Log("Message: " + verificationResult.Message);
});
```

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   -  `ProductId` (`String`): The ID of the product that has been purchased.
   -  `PurchaseToken` (`String`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.VerifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `ajustEvent` (`AdjustEvent`): Your instantiated event object.
   -  `callback` (`Action`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```cs
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.SetRevenue(6.66, "CAD");
adjustEvent.ProductId = "product-id";
adjustEvent.PurchaseToken = "purchase-token";
Adjust.VerifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase(adjustEvent, verificationResult =>
{
    Debug.Log("Verification status: " + verificationResult.VerificationStatus);
    Debug.Log("Code: " + verificationResult.Code);
    Debug.Log("Message: " + verificationResult.Message);
});
```

#### [Only verify purchase](only-verify-purchase)

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App Store" icon="StoreAppStore" sync="appstore">

To send a standalone App Store purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustAppStorePurchase` object with the following arguments:
   -  `ProductId` (`string`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   -  `TransactionId` (`string`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
2. Call the `Adjust.VerifyAppStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `purchase` (`AdjustAppStorePurchase`): Your instantiated event object.
   -  `callback` (`Action`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```cs
AdjustAppStorePurchase purchase = new AdjustAppStorePurchase("product-id", "transaction-id");
Adjust.VerifyAppStorePurchase(purchase, verificationResult =>
{
    Debug.Log("Verification status: " + verificationResult.VerificationStatus);
    Debug.Log("Code: " + verificationResult.Code);
    Debug.Log("Message: " + verificationResult.Message);
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Google Play" icon="PlatformGooglePlay" sync="playstore">

To send a standalone Play Store purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` with the following arguments:
   -  `ProductId` (`string`): The ID of the product that has been purchased.
   -  `PurchaseToken` (`string`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.VerifyPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `purchase` (`AdjustPlayStorePurchase`): Your instantiated purchase object.
   -  `verificationResultCallback` (`Action`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```cs
AdjustPlayStorePurchase purchase = new AdjustPlayStorePurchase("product-id", "purchase-token");
Adjust.VerifyPlayStorePurchase(purchase, verificationResult =>
{
    Debug.Log("Verification status: " + verificationResult.VerificationStatus);
    Debug.Log("Code: " + verificationResult.Code);
    Debug.Log("Message: " + verificationResult.Message);
});
