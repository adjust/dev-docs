<SdkVersion version="v5">

If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you can use the Adjust SDK to request purchase verification. There are two ways to verify purchases with the Adjust SDK:

1. Create an `AdjustEvent` object that represents your purchase and configure purchase properties for the target store.
2. Create an `AdjustAppStorePurchase` (Apple App Store) or `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` (Google Play Store) object representing the purchase.

<Callout type="tip">

If you use revenue events to measure your purchases in Adjust, you should use the `AdjustEvent` class. If you only want to verify a purchase but don't want to associate it with an event, use the `AdjustAppStorePurchase` or `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` class.

</Callout>

When you send purchase information with the Adjust SDK, Adjust does the following:

1. Sends the information to the relevant store and waits for a status response.
2. Forwards the status response to the Adjust SDK.

You can access the purchase verification status by using a callback. Results are returned as `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` objects containing the following properties:

-  `VerificationStatus` (`string`): The status of the purchase.
-  `Code` (`int`): The status code of the purchase.
-  `Message` (`string`): Any message returned by the store.

```cs
public static void VerifyAndTrackAppStorePurchase(AdjustEvent adjustEvent, Action<AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult> callback);
```

</CodeBlock>

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   -  `ProductId` (`string`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   -  `TransactionId` (`string`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
   -  `Receipt` (`string`): The in-app purchase receipt.
2. Call the `Adjust.VerifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `event` (`AdjustEvent`): Your instantiated event object.
   -  `callback` (`Action`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```cs
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.SetRevenue(6.66, "CAD");
adjustEvent.TransactionId = "transaction-id";
adjustEvent.ProductId = "product-id";
adjustEvent.Receipt = "cmVjZWlwdC12ZXJ5LW5pY2U=";
Adjust.VerifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase(adjustEvent, verificationResult =>
{
    Debug.Log("Verification status: " + verificationResult.VerificationStatus);
    Debug.Log("Code: " + verificationResult.Code);
    Debug.Log("Message: " + verificationResult.Message);
});

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   -  `ProductId` (`String`): The ID of the product that has been purchased.
   -  `PurchaseToken` (`String`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.VerifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `ajustEvent` (`AdjustEvent`): Your instantiated event object.
   -  `callback` (`Action`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```cs
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.SetRevenue(6.66, "CAD");
adjustEvent.ProductId = "product-id";
adjustEvent.PurchaseToken = "purchase-token";
Adjust.VerifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase(adjustEvent, verificationResult =>
{
    Debug.Log("Verification status: " + verificationResult.VerificationStatus);
    Debug.Log("Code: " + verificationResult.Code);
    Debug.Log("Message: " + verificationResult.Message);

To send a standalone App Store purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustAppStorePurchase` object with the following arguments:
   -  `ProductId` (`string`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   -  `TransactionId` (`string`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
   -  `Receipt` (`string`): The in-app purchase receipt.
2. Call the `Adjust.VerifyAppStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `purchase` (`AdjustAppStorePurchase`): Your instantiated event object.
   -  `callback` (`Action`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```cs
AdjustAppStorePurchase purchase = new AdjustAppStorePurchase("product-id", "transaction-id", "receipt");
Adjust.VerifyAppStorePurchase(purchase, verificationResult =>
{

To send a standalone Play Store purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` with the following arguments:
   -  `ProductId` (`string`): The ID of the product that has been purchased.
   -  `PurchaseToken` (`string`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.VerifyPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:

If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you must send additional information with your purchase events to verify them. When Adjust's servers receive this information in an event object, they forward it to Apple or Google to verify the purchase depending on what information is included.

<Callout type="seealso">

See [Send event information](/en/sdk/android/features/events) for more information on the `AdjustEvent` class.

-  `receipt` (`string`): The in-app purchase receipt.
