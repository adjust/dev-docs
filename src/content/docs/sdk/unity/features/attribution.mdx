title: Get attribution information
description: Listen for attribution changes using the Adjust SDK
slug: en/sdk/unity/features/attribution
---

When a user interacts with an Adjust link, their attribution information updates. This can happen if the user interacts with a [deep link](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/deep-links). Information about a user's attribution is represented in the `AdjustAttribution` class.

## AdjustAttribution class properties

The `AdjustAttribution` class contains details about the current attribution status of the device. Any values that aren't populated for the user are returned as a `null` value.

<Callout type="note">

The following values can only be accessed if the [`needsCost` property on your `AdjustConfig` instance](/en/sdk/android/configuration#enable-cost-data-sending) is `true`:

-  `costType`
-  `costAmount`
-  `costCurrency`

</Callout>

## Trigger a function when attribution changes

```cs title="Method signature"
public void setAttributionChangedDelegate(Action<AdjustAttribution> attributionChangedDelegate, string sceneName = "Adjust");
```

The SDK can listen for attribution changes and call a function when it detects an update. To configure your callback function, call the `setAttributionChangedDelegate` method with your function name as an argument.

<Callout type="important">

You must call the `setAttributionChangedDelegate` method **before** initializing the Adjust SDK in your app.

</Callout>

```cs {8, 13-16}
using com.adjust.sdk;

public class ExampleGUI : MonoBehaviour {
   void OnGUI() {
      if (GUI.Button(new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height), "callback")) {
         AdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig("{Your App Token}", AdjustEnvironmentSandbox);
         adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel.Verbose);
         adjustConfig.setAttributionChangedDelegate(this.attributionChangedDelegate);
         Adjust.start(adjustConfig);
      }
   }

   public void attributionChangedDelegate(AdjustAttribution attribution) {
      Debug.Log("Attribution changed");
      // ...
   }
}
```

## Get current attribution information

```cs title="Method signature"
public static AdjustAttribution getAttribution();
```

When a user installs your app, Adjust attributes the install to a campaign. The Adjust SDK gives you access to campaign attribution details for your install. To return this information, call the `getAttribution` method to return the attribution information as an `AdjustAttribution` object.

```cs
var attribution = Adjust.getAttribution();
```
