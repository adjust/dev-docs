The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.

## Adjust device identifier

```cs
public static string getAdid();
```

Adjust generates a unique Adjust Device ID (ADID) for each device. Call the `getAdid` method to return this ID as a `string`.

```cs
string adid = Adjust.getAdid();
```

## ID For Advertisers

```cs title="Method signature"
public static string getIdfa();
```

The ID for Advertisers (IDFA) is a device-specific identifier for Apple devices. Call the `getIdfa` method to return this ID as a `string`.

```cs
string idfa = Adjust.getIdfa();
```

## Google Play Services Advertising ID

```cs title="Method signature"
public static void getGoogleAdId(Action<string> onDeviceIdsRead);
```

The Google Play Services Advertising ID (GPS ADID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices.

Users can opt out of sharing their GPS ADID by toggling the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting on their device. When a user enables this setting, the Adjust SDK returns a string of zeros when trying to read the GPS ADID.

You can access this value by calling the `getGoogleAdId` method in a background thread. Assign a delegate function to access the GPS ADID value.

```cs
Adjust.getGoogleAdId((string googleAdId) => {
   //...
});
```

## Amazon Advertiser ID

```cs title="Method signature"
public static string getAmazonAdId();
```

The Amazon Advertising ID (Amazon Ad ID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices. Call the `getAmazonAdId` method to return this ID as a `string`.

```cs
string amazonAdId = Adjust.getAmazonAdId();
```
