You can use the Adjust SDK to record activity from apps that came preinstalled on a user's device. This enables you to send information from users who didn't download your app from a campaign.

Your config object contains a **boolean** `preinstallTrackingEnabled` property that controls this feature. To enable preinstall measurement, call the `setPreinstallTrackingEnabled` method with a `true` argument.

<SetPreinstallTrackingEnabled />

The Adjust SDK provides 5 methods for measuring preinstalled apps:

* [System Properties](#system-properties) (Android only).
* [Content provider](#content-provider) (Android only).
* [System Installer Receiver](#system-installer-receiver) (Android only).
* [World Readable Directory](#world-readable-directory) (Android only).
* [Default campaign](#default-campaign) (iOS and Android).

## System properties

OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) partners can leverage Android system properties to attribute preinstalled apps. The OEM writes attribution information to a file and adds its path to the system properties. The Adjust SDK reads this file on initialization to attribute the install.

## Content provider

The content provider method makes use of a read-only content provider. The SDK uses a content resolver to gather preinstall information from the request.

To set the permissions, add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```xml title="AndroidManifest.xml"
<uses-permission android:name="com.adjust.preinstall.READ_PERMISSION"/>
```

To access a list of preinstalled apps on the device, add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```xml title="AndroidManifest.xml"
<queries>
   <intent>
       <action android:name="com.attribution.REFERRAL_PROVIDER"/>
   </intent>
</queries>
```

## System installer receiver

The system installer method uses a broadcast receiver. The system installer broadcasts preinstall information. The Adjust SDK reads this information using the system preinstall referrer receiver.

To set up the receiver, add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```xml title="AndroidManifest.xml"
<receiver android:name="com.adjust.sdk.AdjustPreinstallReferrerReceiver"> 
   <intent-filter> 
      <action android:name="com.attribution.SYSTEM_INSTALLER_REFERRER" /> 
   </intent-filter> 
</receiver>
```

## World-readable directory

Save attribution information for your preinstalled app in a world-readable directory. The SDK reads the information from this file at install to attribute the user. The system encryption protocol protects app data.

Pass the file path at which your preinstall information can be found to the `setPreinstallFilePath` method to give the Adjust SDK access to the information.

<SetPreinstallFilePath />

## Default campaign

Configuring a default campaign enables you to attribute all preinstalls to a predefined campaign token. Adjust records all information against this token until the attribution source changes. To set this up:

1. Create a new link in Adjust.
   
   ```http "{token}"
   https://app.adjust.com/{token}
   ```

2. Copy this token and pass it to the `setDefaultTracker` method in your app delegate file.

   <SetDefaultTracker />

3. Build and run your app. If you have logging enabled, you should see a message in your log

   ```text
   Default tracker: 'abc123'.
   ```
