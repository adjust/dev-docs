By default, the Adjust SDK pauses the sending of requests when your app is running in the background. You can configure the SDK to send requests in the background by enabling the background recording feature.

Your config object contains a boolean `sendInBackground` property that controls this behavior. You can set this property by calling the `setSendInBackground` method on your config instance with a boolean value.

<Callout type="important">

You must set the `sendInBackground` property *before* you initialize the Adjust SDK.

</Callout>
