If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you must send additional information with your purchase events to verify them. When Adjust's servers receive this information in an event object, they forward it to Apple or Google to verify the purchase depending on what information is included.

See [Send event information](/en/sdk/android/features/events) for more information on the `AdjustEvent` class.

To verify an App Store purchase, instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with your event token and set the following properties:

-  `productId` (`string`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
-  `transactionId` (`string`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
-  `receipt` (`string`): The in-app purchase receipt.

```cs
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.setRevenue(6.0, "EUR");
adjustEvent.setProductId("product-id");
adjustEvent.setTransactionId("transaction-id");
adjustEvent.setReceipt("receipt");
Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

To verify a Play Store purchase, instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with your event token and set the following properties:

-  `productId` (`string`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
-  `purchaseToken` (`string`): The purchase token generated for your successfully completed in-app purchase.

```cs
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.setRevenue(6.0, "EUR");
adjustEvent.setProductId("product-id");
adjustEvent.setPurchaseToken("purchase-token");
Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);
