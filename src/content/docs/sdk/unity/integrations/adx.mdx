<SdkVersion version="v5">

You can use the Adjust SDK to send AD(X) data to Adjust as an `AdjustAdRevenue` instance. To do this:

1. Create a new function that triggers when the `rewardedAd.OnPaidEvent` method is called in the AD(X) SDK. This function should receive the eCPM (Effective Cost Per Mille) amount as an argument.
2. Instantiate an [`AdjustAdRevenue` object](/en/sdk/unity/features/ad-revenue) with the source `"adx_sdk"`.
3. Fill in the details of your `AdjustAdRevenue` object. Divide the `ecpm` value by 1000 to return the estimated revenue for the ad.
4. Send the ad revenue information to Adjust by calling the `Adjust.TrackAdRevenue` method.

<Callout type="seealso">

For more information about the `rewardedAd.OnPaidEvent` method, see [AD(X)'s rewarded ad documentation](https://docs.adxcorp.kr/unity/sdk-integration/ad-formats/rewarded-ad/ad-x#id-4.-a-d-revenue-onpaidevent)

</Callout>

## [Example](example)

```cs
rewardedAd.OnPaidEvent += RewardedAd_OnPaidEvent;

void RewardedAd_OnPaidEvent(double ecpm)
{
  double revenue = ecpm / 1000f;

  AdjustAdRevenue adRevenue = new AdjustAdRevenue("adx_sdk");
  adRevenue.SetRevenue(revenue, "USD");
  adRevenue.AdRevenueUnit = "ADX Rewarded Ad";

  Adjust.TrackAdRevenue(adRevenue);
}
```
