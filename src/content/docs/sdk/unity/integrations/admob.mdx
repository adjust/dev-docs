## Before you begin

To use this feature, you need to first reach out to your Google representative and request access. Once that's done, you can proceed with setup in Adjust.

### Requirements

-  Adjust Unity SDK v4.29.0 and later

## Examples

```c#
this.rewardedAd.OnPaidEvent += this.HandleAdPaidEvent;
public void HandleAdPaidEvent(object sender, AdValueEventArgs args)
{
    // for more information, please check AdMob official docs at:
    // https://developers.google.com/admob/unity/impression-level-ad-revenue
    AdValue adValue = args.AdValue;
    AdapterResponseInfo loadedAdapterResponseInfo = rewardedAd.GetResponseInfo().GetLoadedAdapterResponseInfo();

    // send ad revenue info to Adjust
    AdjustAdRevenue adRevenue = new AdjustAdRevenue(AdjustConfig.AdjustAdRevenueSourceAdMob);
    adRevenue.setRevenue(adValue.Value / 1000000f, adValue.CurrencyCode);
    adRevenue.setAdRevenueNetwork(loadedAdapterResponseInfo.AdSourceName)
    Adjust.trackAdRevenue(adRevenue);
}
```
