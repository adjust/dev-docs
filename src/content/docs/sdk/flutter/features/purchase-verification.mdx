If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you can use the Adjust SDK to request purchase verification. There are two ways to verify purchases with the Adjust SDK:

1. Create an `AdjustEvent` object that represents your purchase and configure purchase properties for the target store.
2. Create an `AdjustAppStorePurchase` (Apple App Store) or `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` (Google Play Store) object representing the purchase.

<Callout type="tip">

If you use revenue events to measure your purchases in Adjust, you should use the `AdjustEvent` class. If you only want to verify a purchase but don't want to associate it with an event, use the `AdjustAppStorePurchase` or `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` class.

</Callout>

When you send purchase information with the Adjust SDK, Adjust does the following:

1. Sends the information to the relevant store and waits for a status response.
2. Forwards the status response to the Adjust SDK.

You can access the purchase verification status by using a callback. Results are returned as `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` objects containing the following properties:

-  `verificationStatus` (`String`): The status of the purchase.
-  `code` (`num`): The status code of the purchase.
-  `message` (`String`): Any message returned by the store.

```dart

</CodeBlock>

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   -  `productId` (`String`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   -  `transactionId` (`String`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
2. Call the `Adjust.VerifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following argument:
   -  `event` (`AdjustEvent`): Your instantiated event object. Expect the verification response to arrive as part of the Future<AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult?> return value.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```dart
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent('abc123';);
adjustEvent.setRevenue(6.66, 'CAD');
adjustEvent.transactionId = 'transaction-id';
adjustEvent.productId = 'product-id';
Adjust.verifyAndTrackAppStorePurchase(adjustEvent).then((result) {
        print('Verification status = $result?.verificationStatus');
        print(Code = $result?.code.toString()');
        print(Message = $result?.message');
}
```

   -  `purchaseToken` (`String`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following argument:
   -  `adjustEvent` (`AdjustEvent`): Your instantiated event object. Expect the verification response to arrive as part of the Future<AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult?> return value.

Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase(adjustEvent).then((result) {
        print('Verification status = $result?.verificationStatus');
        print(Code = $result?.code.toString()');

To send a standalone App Store purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustAppStorePurchase` object with the following arguments:
   -  `productId` (`String`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   -  `transactionId` (`String`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAppStorePurchase` method with the following argument:
   -  `purchase` (`AdjustAppStorePurchase`): Your instantiated event object. Expect the verification response to arrive as part of the Future<AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult?> return value.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```dart
AdjustAppStorePurchase purchase = new AdjustAppStorePurchase('product-id', 'transaction-id');
Adjust.verifyAppStorePurchase(purchase).then((result) {
        print('Verification status = $result?.verificationStatus');
        print(Code = $result?.code.toString()');
        print(Message = $result?.message');

To send a standalone Play Store purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` with the following arguments:
   -  `productId` (`String`): The ID of the product that has been purchased.
   -  `purchaseToken` (`String`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.VerifyPlayStorePurchase` method with the following argument:

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

```dart
AdjustPlayStorePurchase purchase = new AdjustPlayStorePurchase('product-id', purchase-token');
Adjust.verifyPlayStorePurchase(purchase).then((result) {
        print('Verification status = $result?.verificationStatus');
        print(Code = $result?.code.toString()');
        print(Message = $result?.message');
