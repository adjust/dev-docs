The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.

## Adjust device identifier

```dart title="Method signature"
static Future<String?> getAdid() async
```

Adjust generates a unique Adjust Device ID (ADID) for each device. Call the `getAdid` method to return this ID as a `String`.

```dart
Adjust.getAdid().then((adid) {
  // Use adid string value.
});
```

## ID For Advertisers

```dart title="Method signature"
static Future<String?> getIdfa() async
```

The ID for Advertisers (IDFA) is a device-specific identifier for Apple devices. Call the `getIdfa` method to return this ID as a `String`.

```dart
Adjust.getIdfa().then((idfa) {
  // Use idfa string value.
});
```

## Google Play Services Advertising ID

```dart title="Method signature"
static Future<String?> getGoogleAdId() async
```

The Google Play Services Advertising ID (GPS ADID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices.

Users can opt out of sharing their GPS ADID by toggling the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting on their device. When a user enables this setting, the Adjust SDK returns a string of zeros when trying to read the GPS ADID.

You can access this value by calling the `getGoogleAdId` method in a background thread. Assign a delegate function to access the GPS ADID value.

```dart
Adjust.getGoogleAdId().then((googleAdId) {
  // Use googleAdId string value.
});
```

## Amazon Advertiser ID

```dart title="Method signature"
static Future<String?> getAmazonAdId() async
```

The Amazon Advertising ID (Amazon Ad ID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices. Call the `getAmazonAdId` method to return this ID as a `String`.

```dart
Adjust.getAmazonAdId().then((amazonAdId) {
  // Use amazonAdId string value.
});
```
