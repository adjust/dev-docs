The Adjust SDK runs by default when your app is open. You can disable and re-enable the Adjust SDK to pause and resume recording. When you disable the Adjust SDK, it doesn't send any data to Adjust's servers.

import SetEnabledSig from "@windows-signatures/Adjust/SetEnabled.mdx";

You can enable or disable the SDK at any time by calling the `SetEnabled` method with a **boolean** argument.

<Callout type="important">

You can only call this method after the first session. This setting persists between sessions.

</Callout>

import SetEnabled from "@windows-examples/Adjust/SetEnabled.mdx";

<SetEnabled />

## Check enabled status

import IsEnabledSig from "@windows-signatures/Adjust/IsEnabled.mdx";

You can check if the Adjust SDK is enabled at any time by calling the `IsEnabled` method. This method returns a boolean value.

import IsEnabled from "@windows-examples/Adjust/IsEnabled.mdx";

<IsEnabled />
