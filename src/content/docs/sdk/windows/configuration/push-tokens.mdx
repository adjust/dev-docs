Push tokens are used for [Audience Builder](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/audience-builder) and client callbacks. They're also required for [Uninstall and reinstall measurement](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/uninstalls-reinstalls).

Your config object contains a string `PushToken` property that you can use to store your push token. You can update this property at any time by calling the `SetPushToken` method and passing your token as an argument.

<SetPushToken />

This example shows how to set a new push token with the value `HrFmrcq96tj723aWFfrw` to record your app's retention rates. You can update this value at any time by passing a new token to the `SetPushToken` method as an argument:

```c#
Adjust.SetPushToken("HrFmrcq96tj723aWFfrw");
```
