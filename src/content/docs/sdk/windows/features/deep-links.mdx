You can create deep links to take users to specific pages in your app. The Adjust SDK uses different logic depending on if the user already has your app installed on their device:

-  Direct deep linking: occurs if the user already has your app installed. The link takes the user to the page specified in the link
-  Deferred deep linking: occurs if the user doesn't have your app installed. The link takes the user to a storefront to install your app first. After the user installs the app, it opens to the page specified in the link.

The SDK can read deep link data after a user opens your app from a link.

## Set up deep linking {#set-up-deep-linking}

If a user has your app installed, it opens when they interact with a link containing deep link information. The Adjust SDK contains tools to parse deep link information for use throughout your app. To configure deep linking in your app, you need to choose a unique scheme name and assign it to a specified handler method. To do this:

1. Open the **Solution Explorer**.
2. Double click `Package.appxmanifest` to open the manifest designer.
3. Select the **Declarations tab**.
4. Select **Available Declarations --> Protocol** and select **Add**.
5. Choose a name for your URI scheme. The URI scheme name must be **lowercase**.
6. Press **Ctrl+S** to save your changes.

Next, you need to set up your `OnActivated` event handler. This handles the activated deep link event. To set this up, add the following to your your `App.xaml.cs` file:

<CodeBlock title="App.xaml.cs">

```cs
// ...
protected override void OnActivated(IActivatedEventArgs args) {
   if (args.Kind == ActivationKind.Protocol) {
      var eventArgs = args as ProtocolActivatedEventArgs;
      if (eventArgs != null) {
         // to get deep link URI:
         Uri deeplink = eventArgs.Uri;
         // ...
      }
   }
   base.OnActivated(args);
}
// ...
```

</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="seealso">

Check the official [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/handle-uri-activation) for URI activation handling for more information.

</Callout>

Your app opens when a user interacts with a link containing your **unique scheme name** in the `deep_link` parameter. This value must be URL-encoded in the URL. The Adjust SDK delivers the result as unencoded text.

## Deferred deep linking {#deferred-deep-linking}

<CodeBlock title="Property declaration">

```cs
public Func<Uri, bool> DeeplinkResponse { get; set; }
```

</CodeBlock>

You can configure the Adjust SDK to call a delegate function when it receives a deferred deep link. This delegate function receives the deep link as a `string` argument. Once the SDK receives the deep link content from Adjust's servers, it delivers it through this delegate function and expects a `bool` return value. This value represents whether the SDK should launch the `OnActivated` event handler.

<CodeBlock highlight="{range: 4-14}">

```cs
var adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment,
   msg => System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(msg), LogLevel.Verbose);

adjustConfig.DeeplinkResponse = deepLinkUri =>
{
   if (ShouldAdjustSdkLaunchTheDeeplink(deepLinkUri))
   {
      return true;
   }
   else
   {
      return false;
   }
};

Adjust.ApplicationLaunching(adjustConfig);
// ...
```

</CodeBlock>

## Reattribution using deep links {#reattribution-using-deep-links}

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```cs
public static void AppWillOpenUrl(Uri uri);
```

</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="seealso">

Adjust enables you to run re-engagement campaigns with usage of deep links. For more information, see the [guide to appending attribution data to a deep link](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/manage-reattributions#track-reattributions-via-deep-link-clicks).

</Callout>

To reattribute a user, you need to make an extra call to the Adjust SDK within your app. Add a call to the `appWillOpenUrl(Uri, Context)` method when the app receives deep link content. The Adjust SDK will then look for new attribution data within the deep link. If the SDK finds new information, it will forward it to Adjust's servers for reattribution.

If the user needs to be reattributed due to clicking on an Adjust deep link, this triggers the [attribution callback](/en/sdk/windows/features/attribution).

You must call `Adjust.AppWillOpenUrl` in the `OnActivated` method of your app:

<CodeBlock highlight="{range: 8-10}">

```cs
using AdjustSdk;

public partial class App : Application
{
   protected override void OnActivated(IActivatedEventArgs args) {
      if (args.Kind == ActivationKind.Protocol) {
         var eventArgs = args as ProtocolActivatedEventArgs;
         if (eventArgs != null) {
            Adjust.AppWillOpenUrl(eventArgs.Uri);
         }
      }
      //...
   }
}
```

</CodeBlock>
