When a user interacts with a campaign link or a [deep link](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/deep-links), their attribution information updates. The SDK can listen for attribution changes and call a function when it detects an update.

<Callout type="important">

You must call the `AttributionChanged` method **before** initializing the Adjust SDK in your app.

</Callout>

<AttributionChanged />

Within your delegate function, you have access to the user's Attribution object. See the [`AdjustAttribution` class reference](/en/sdk/windows/reference/adjustattribution) for a list of available parameters.

## Get current attribution information

(Available from v4.12.0 and later.) When a user installs your app, Adjust attributes the install to a campaign. The Adjust SDK gives you access to campaign attribution details for your install. To return this information, call the `GetAttribution` method.

This method returns an Attribution object. See the [`AdjustAttribution` class reference](/en/sdk/windows/reference/adjustattribution) for a list of available properties.

<Attribution />
