When a user interacts with an Adjust link, their attribution information updates. This can happen if the user interacts with a [deep link](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/deep-links). Information about a user's attribution is represented in the `AdjustAttribution` class.

## AdjustAttribution class properties

The `AdjustAttribution` class contains details about the current attribution status of the device. Any values that aren't populated for the user are returned as a `null` value.

<Table>

## Trigger a function when attribution changes

```c# title="Property declaration"
public Action<AdjustAttribution> AttributionChanged { get; set; }
```

The SDK can listen for attribution changes and call a function when it detects an update. To configure your callback function, assign your function to the `AttributionChanged` property on your config instance. You can pass the name of a function or write the function inline.

<Callout type="important">

You must call the `AttributionChanged` method **before** initializing the Adjust SDK in your app.

</Callout>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Inline function">

```c# {3,4}
var config = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);

config.AttributionChanged = (attribution) =>
   System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("attribution: " + attribution);

Adjust.ApplicationLaunching(config);
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Function name">

```c# "AdjustAttributionChanged"
var config = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);
config.AttributionChanged = AdjustAttributionChanged;
Adjust.ApplicationLaunching(config);

private void AdjustAttributionChanged(AdjustAttribution attribution)
{
   //...
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Get current attribution information

```c# title="Method signature"
public static AdjustAttribution GetAttribution();
```

<MinorVersion added="v4.12.0">

When a user installs your app, Adjust attributes the install to a campaign. The Adjust SDK gives you access to campaign attribution details for your install. To return this information, call the `GetAttribution` method to return the attribution information as an `AdjustAttribution` object.

</MinorVersion>

```c#
AdjustAttribution attribution = Adjust.GetAttribution();
```
