The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.

## Adjust device identifier

```cs title="Method signature"
public static string GetAdid();
```

Adjust generates a unique Adjust Device ID (ADID) for each device. Call the `GetAdid` method to return this ID as a `string`.

```cs
string adid = Adjust.GetAdid();
```

## Windows advertising identifier

```cs title="Method signature"
public static string GetWindowsAdId();
```

The Windows Advertising ID (Windows ADID) is a device-specific identifier for Windows devices. Call the `GetWindowsAdId` method to return this ID as a `string`.

```cs
var windowsAdid = Adjust.GetWindowsAdId();
```
