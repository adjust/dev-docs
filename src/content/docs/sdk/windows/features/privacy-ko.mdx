Adjust SDK에는 앱에서 사용자 프라이버시를 관리할 수 있는 기능이 포함되어 있습니다.

## 삭제 요청 전송

```cs
public static void GdprForgetMe();
```

The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\) and similar privacy laws worldwide \(CCPA, LGPD, etc.\) grant data subjects comprehensive rights when it comes to the processing of their personal data. These rights include, among others, the right to erasure \(see [Art. 17 GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/article-17-right-to-be-forgotten/)\)\([1](https://help.adjust.com/ko/article/gdpr#ref-1)\). As a data processor, Adjust is obliged to support you \(the data controller\) in the processing of such requests from your \(app\) users.

You can send the user's erasure request to Adjust by calling the `gdprForgetMe` method. Once Adjust has been notified:

-  Adjust will permanently delete all of the user’s historical personal data from its internal systems and database.
-  Adjust will no longer receive data from this user/device via the Adjust SDK.\([2](https://help.adjust.com/ko/article/gdpr#ref-2)\)

```cs
Adjust.GdprForgetMe();
```
