The Adjust Windows SDK enables you to record attribution, events, and more in your Windows app. Follow the steps in this guide to set up your app to work with the Adjust SDK.

1\. Add the Adjust SDK to your project
---------------------------------------

To use the Adjust SDK in your Windows app, you need to add it to your Visual Studio project. You can download the latest version from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/adjust/windows_sdk/releases/latest).

### Using NuGet

To add the SDK using NuGet:

1. Right click on the project in the **Solution Explorer** to open the **NuGet Package Manager** window.
2. Select **Manage NuGet Packages...** .
3. Select the **Browse tab** .
4. Enter `adjust` in the search box and hit **Return** to search for the Adjust SDK.
5. The Adjust SDK should appear at the top of the list. Select it and select **Install** to install the package.

### Using the Package Manager Console

To install the Adjust SDK using the Package Manager Console:

1. Select **TOOLS \-\-> NuGet Package Manager \-\-> Package Manager Console** to open the Package Manager Console view.
2. Enter the following install command in the prompt and hit **Return** to run it.

```console
PM> Install-Package Adjust
```

2\. Integrate the SDK
----------------------

Once you've added the Adjust SDK to your Visual Studio project, you need to integrate it in your app.

1. Open the Solution Explorer.
2. Open the `App.xaml.cs` file.
3. Add the following directive to the top of the file:

```cs
using AdjustSdk;
```

3\. Initialize the Adjust SDK
------------------------------

To initialize the Adjust SDK, you need to create a config object. This object contains configuration options that control how the Adjust SDK behaves. Pass the following arguments for a minimal setup:

* `appToken`: Your app's token.
* `environment`: The environment you want to run the SDK in. Set this to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox`.

To initialize the Adjust SDK with this config object:

1. Declare your config object in the `OnLaunched` method of your app.
2. Pass the config object as an argument to the `Adjust.ApplicationLaunching` method.

```cs
using AdjustSdk;

sealed partial class App : Application
{
   protected override void OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs e)
   {
      string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
      string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;
      var config = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);
      Adjust.ApplicationLaunching(config);
   // ...
   }
}
```

4\. Configure the Adjust SDK
-----------------------------

Once you've added your config object and initialization logic, you can configure the Adjust SDK to record information about different parts of your app. Check out the guides for the SDK's [configuration](/en/sdk/windows/configuration) and [features](/en/sdk/windows/features) to set up exactly what you want to record.

5\. Build and debug your app
-----------------------------

Once you've integrated the Adjust SDK and set it up, you can start the Visual Studio debugger to check that the SDK is logging as expected. To do this:

1. Select **Debug \-\-> Start Debugging** to open the debugger.
2. Check the **Output** tab to see your app's logs. Adjust SDK logs are displayed with an **\[Adjust\]** tag.
