If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you can use the Adjust SDK to request purchase verification. There are two ways to verify purchases with the Adjust SDK:

1. Create an `AdjustEvent` object that represents your purchase and add the following properties:
   -  `productId` (`String`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   -  `purchaseToken` (`String`): The purchase token generated for your successfully completed in-app purchase.
2. Create an `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` object with your product ID and purchase token.

<Callout type="tip">

If you use revenue events to measure your purchases in Adjust, you should use the `AdjustEvent` class. If you only want to verify a purchase but don't want to associate it with an event, use the `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` class.

</Callout>

When you send purchase information with the Adjust SDK, Adjust does the following:

1. Sends the information to Google Play and waits for a status response.
2. Forwards the status response to the Adjust SDK.

You can access the purchase verification status by using a callback. Results are returned as `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` objects containing the following properties:

-  `verificationStatus` (`String`): The status of the purchase.
-  `code` (`int`): The status code of the purchase.
-  `message` (`String`): Any message returned by Google Play.

## [Record event and verify purchase](record-event-and-verify-purchase)

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```java
public static void verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase(final AdjustEvent event, OnPurchaseVerificationFinishedListener callback)
```

</CodeBlock>

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   -  `productId` (`String`): The ID of the product that has been purchased.
   -  `purchaseToken` (`String`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `event` (`AdjustEvent`): Your instantiated event object.
   -  `callback` (`OnPurchaseVerificationFinishedListener`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

To send a standalone purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` with the following arguments:
   -  `productId` (`String`): The ID of the product that has been purchased.
   -  `purchaseToken` (`String`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:

   -  `callback` (`OnPurchaseVerificationFinishedListener`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

<SdkVersion version="v4">

If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you must send additional information with your purchase events to verify them. When Adjust's servers receive this information in an `AdjustEvent` object, they forward it to Google to verify the purchase.

To verify a purchase, instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with your event token and set the following properties:

-  `productId` (`String`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased
-  `purchaseToken` (`String`): The purchase token generated for your successfully completed in-app purchase

See [Send event information](/en/sdk/android/features/events) for more information on the `AdjustEvent` class.
