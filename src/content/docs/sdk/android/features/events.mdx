You can associate your [Adjust event tokens](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/add-events#add-event) to actions in your app to record them. To record an event:

-  Create a new Adjust event instance and pass your event token as a string argument.
-  Call the `trackEvent` method with your event instance as an argument.

<TrackEvent />

This example shows how to record an event with the token `g3mfiw` whenever a user interacts with a button.

## Record event revenue

You can record revenue associated with an event by setting the revenue and currency properties on your event instance. Use this feature to record revenue-generating actions in your app.

To set these properties, call the `setRevenue` method and pass the following arguments:

`revenue` (**number**): The amount of revenue generated by the event

`currency` (**string**): The [ISO 4217 code](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes) of the event currency.

<Callout type="seealso">

Check the guide to [tracking purchases in different currencies](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/currency-conversion) for more information.

</Callout>

<SetRevenue />

### Example

This example shows how to record an event with the token `g3mfiw` whenever a user interacts with a button. The function sets the `revenue` property of this event to _`0.25`_ and the `currency` property to _`EUR`_.

<SetRevenueExample />

```txt title="Event log" {7,8}
Path:      /event
ClientSdk: android4.38.0
Parameters:
  environment      sandbox
  event_count      3
  event_token      abc123
  revenue          0.25
  currency         EUR
```

### Purchase verification

<MinorVersion added="v3.34.0">

If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you must send additional information with your purchase events to verify them. When Adjust's servers receive this information in an event object, they forward it to Apple to verify the purchase.

</MinorVersion>

`productId` (String): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased

`purchaseToken` (String): The purchase token generated for your successfully completed in-app purchase

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Kotlin" sync="kotlin">

```kotlin
val adjustEvent = AdjustEvent("abc123")
adjustEvent.setRevenue(6.0, "EUR");
adjustEvent.setProductId("product-id");
adjustEvent.setPurchaseToken("purchase-token");
Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Java" sync="java">

```java
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.setRevenue(6.0, "EUR");
adjustEvent.setProductId("product-id");
adjustEvent.setPurchaseToken("purchase-token");
Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Unique events

You can pass an optional identifier to avoid recording duplicate events. The SDK stores the last ten identifiers and skips revenue events with duplicate transaction IDs.

To set the identifier, call the `setOrderId` method and pass your transaction ID as a **string** argument.

<SetOrderId />

### Example

This example shows how to record an event with the token `g3mfiw` whenever a user interacts with a button. The function sets the `orderId` to `5e85484b-1ebc-4141-aab7-25b869e54c49` using the `setOrderId` method.

<SetOrderIdExample />

```txt title="Event log" {7}
Path:      /event
ClientSdk: android4.38.0
Parameters:
  environment      sandbox
  event_count      3
  event_token      abc123
  order_id         5e85484b-1ebc-4141-aab7-25b869e54c49
```

## Add callback parameters

If you [register a callback URL](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/set-up-callbacks) in the Adjust dashboard, the SDK sends a GET request to your callback URL when it records an event.

You can configure callback parameters to send to your servers. Once you configure parameters on an event, the SDK appends them to your [callback URL](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/raw-data-exports). You can use this information to analyze your users' in-app behavior with your BI system.

Add callback parameters to your event by calling the `addCallbackParameter` method with **string** key-value arguments. You can add multiple parameters by calling this method multiple times.

<AddCallbackParameter />

The Adjust SDK measures the event and sends a request to your URL with the callback parameters. For example, if you register the URL `https://www.mydomain.com/callback`, your callback looks like this:

```http "key=value" "foo=bar"
https://www.mydomain.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar
```

<Callout type="note">

Adjust doesn't store your custom callback parameters. Custom parameters are only appended to your callback URL.

</Callout>

If you're using CSV uploads, make sure to add the parameters to your CSV definition.

Adjust supports many placeholders which you can use to pass information from the SDK to your URL. For example, the `{idfa}` placeholder for iOS and the `{gps_adid}` placeholder for Android. The `{publisher_parameter}` placeholder presents all callback parameters in a single string.

<Callout type="seealso">

You can read more about using URL callbacks, including a full list of available values, in the [callbacks guide](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/callbacks).

</Callout>

### Example

This example shows how to record an event with the token `g3mfiw` whenever a user interacts with a button. The following callback parameters are added:

-  The `event_token`
-  The `revenue_amount` generated by the event

The resulting callback URL looks like this:

```http "event_token=g3mfiw" "revenue_amount=0.05"
http://www.mydomain.com/callback?event_token=g3mfiw&revenue_amount=0.05
```

<AddCallbackParameterExample />

You can check the parameters were sent to Adjust by checking for `callback_params` in your logs.

```txt {4} title="Event log"
Path:      /event
ClientSdk: android4.38.0
Parameters:
  callback_params  {"event_token":"g3mfiw","revenue_amount":"0.05"}
  environment      sandbox
  event_count      1
  event_token      g3mfiw
```

## Add partner parameters

You can send extra information to your network partners by adding [partner parameters](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/data-sharing-ad-network#map-parameters).

Adjust sends partner parameters to [external partners](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/integrated-partners) you have set up. This information is useful for more granular analysis and retargeting purposes. Adjust's servers forward these parameters once you have set them up and enabled them for a partner.

<Callout type="note">

Partner parameters don't appear in raw data by default. You can add the `{partner_parameters}` placeholder to receive them as a single string.

</Callout>

Add partner parameters to your event by calling the `addPartnerParameter` method with **string** key-value arguments. You can add multiple parameters by calling this method multiple times.

<AddPartnerParameter />

### Example

This example shows how to record an event with the token `g3mfiw` whenever a user interacts with a button. The following partner parameters are added:

-  The `product_id` of the associated product
-  The `user_id` of the user who triggered the event

<AddPartnerParameterExample />

You can check the parameters were sent to Adjust by checking for `partner_params` in your logs.

```txt title="Event log" {4}
Path:      /event
ClientSdk: android4.38.0
Parameters:
  partner_params  {"product_id":"29","user_id":"835"}
  environment      sandbox
  event_count      1
  event_token      g3mfiw
```

## Add a callback identifier

You can add a custom string identifier to each event you want to measure. Adjust's servers can report on this identifier in event callbacks. This enables you to keep track of which events have been successfully measured.

Set up this identifier by calling the `setCallbackId` method with your ID as a **string** argument.

<SetCallbackId />

### Example

This example shows how to record an event with the token `g3mfiw` whenever a user interacts with a button. In this example, the `callbackId` is set to `f2e728d8-271b-49ab-80ea-27830a215147`.

<SetCallbackIdExample />

```txt title="Event log" {7}
Path:      /event
ClientSdk: android4.38.0
Parameters:
  environment      sandbox
  event_count      3
  event_token      g3mfiw
  callback_id      f2e728d8-271b-49ab-80ea-27830a215147
```
