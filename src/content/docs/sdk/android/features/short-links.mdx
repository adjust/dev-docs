<SdkVersion version="v5">

Adjust's [link shortener solution](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/short-branded-links) converts your complex and long links into cleaner and shorter links. The shortened links retain deep link and campaign information, and route users to the app store, if they don't have your app installed.

Use the method described in this section to resolve your short links.

## [Set up deep linking in the Adjust SDK](set-up-deep-linking-in-the-adjust-sdk)

In the Adjust SDK, add support for the following:

-  [URI schemes](/en/sdk/android/features/deep-links)
-  [Deferred deep linking](/en/sdk/android/features/deep-links#deferred-deep-linking)

<Callout type="note">

You don't need to set up [Link resolution](/en/sdk/android/features/deep-links#link-resolution) to use Adjust’s link shortener solution.

</Callout>

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```java
public static void processAndResolveDeeplink(Uri url, Context context, OnDeeplinkResolvedListener callback)
```

</CodeBlock>

Call the `processAndResolveDeeplink` method to resolve a short Adjust link URL that deep linked users into your app.

```java
Adjust.processAndResolveDeeplink(webpageURL, context, new OnDeeplinkResolvedListener() {
  @Override
  public void onDeeplinkResolved(String resolvedLink) {
    // resolvedLink contains either resolved URL (if it was unshortened)
    // or just echoed URL if it was not shortened
  }
});
```

In case the link you sent to `processDeeplink` method was shortened, `resolvedLink` returns the extended original link. In case the link you passed to the method wasn't shortened, then `resolvedLink` contains the same link you have passed.
