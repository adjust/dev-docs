The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.


## Adjust device identifier

Adjust generates a unique <Abbr>ADID (Adjust Device ID)</Abbr> for each device. Call the <Tooltip>`adid` method || <AdidSig /></Tooltip> to return this ID as a **string**.

<Adid />

## Google Play Services Advertising ID

The <Abbr>GPS ADID (Google Play Services Advertising ID)</Abbr> is a device-specific identifier for Android devices.

Users can opt out of sharing their GPS ADID by toggling the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting on their device. When a user enables this setting, the Adjust SDK returns a string of zeros when trying to read the GPS ADID.

You can access this value by calling the <Tooltip>`getGoogleAdId` method || <GetGoogleAdIdSig /></Tooltip> in a background thread. Assign a delegate function to access the GPS ADID value.

<GetGoogleAdId />

## Amazon Advertiser ID

The <Abbr>Amazon Ad ID (Amazon Advertising ID)</Abbr> is a device-specific identifier for Android devices. Call the <Tooltip>`getAmazonAdId` method || <GetAmazonAdIdSig /></Tooltip> to return this ID as a **string**.

<GetAmazonAdId />
