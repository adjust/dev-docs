The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.


## Adjust device identifier

Adjust generates a unique ADID (Adjust Device ID) for each device. Call the `adid` method to return this ID as a **string**.

<Adid />

## Google Play Services Advertising ID

The GPS ADID (Google Play Services Advertising ID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices.

Users can opt out of sharing their GPS ADID by toggling the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting on their device. When a user enables this setting, the Adjust SDK returns a string of zeros when trying to read the GPS ADID.

You can access this value by calling the `getGoogleAdId` method in a background thread. Assign a delegate function to access the GPS ADID value.

<GetGoogleAdId />

## Amazon Advertiser ID

The Amazon Ad ID (Amazon Advertising ID) is a device-specific identifier for Android devices. Call the `getAmazonAdId` method to return this ID as a **string**.

<GetAmazonAdId />
