The Adjust SDK runs by default when your app is open. You can disable and re-enable the Adjust SDK to pause and resume recording. When you disable the Adjust SDK, it doesn't send any data to Adjust's servers.

You can enable or disable the SDK at any time by calling the `setEnabled` method with a boolean argument.

<Callout type="important">

You can only call this method after the first session. This setting persists between sessions.

</Callout>

<SetEnabled />

## Check enabled status

You can check if the Adjust SDK is enabled at any time by calling the `isEnabled` method. This method returns a boolean value.

<IsEnabled />
