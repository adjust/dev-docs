This guide shows you how to migrate from Adjust's Purchase verification SDK to SDK v5's built-in purchase verification features. The SDK v5 purchase verification workflow is a streamlined approach to purchase verification.

With the Purchase Verification SDK, verification is split into three steps:

1. Initialize the Purchase Verification SDK.

```java
String yourAppToken = "{YourAppToken}";
String environment = ADJPConstants.ENVIRONMENT_SANDBOX;

ADJPConfig config = new ADJPConfig(yourAppToken, environment);

AdjustPurchase.init(config);
```

2. Verify your purchase.

```java
AdjustPurchase.verifyPurchase(purchase.getSku(),
                              purchase.getToken(),
                              purchase.getDeveloperPayload(),
                              new OnADJPVerificationFinished() {
    @Override
    public void onVerificationFinished(ADJPVerificationInfo info) {
        // process ADJPVerificationInfo
    }
});
```

3. Depending on the outcome of the verification, configure an `AdjustEvent` object and send it to Adjust.

```java
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.setRevenue(6.0, "EUR");
adjustEvent.setProductId("product-id");
adjustEvent.setPurchaseToken("purchase-token");
Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

In SDK v5, this workflow is simplified. The `Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase()` method allows you to send an event to Adjust's servers and receive the verification status as a callback. Adjust records the event and the verification status automatically.

## [Guide](guide)

Follow the steps in this guide to migrate from the Purchase Verification SDK to SDK v5 built-in purchase verification.

### [1. Uninstall the Purchase Verification SDK](uninstall-the-pv-sdk)

To get started, uninstall the Adjust Purchase Verification SDK.

### [2. Remove Purchase Verification SDK code](remove-pv-sdk-code)

Once you've uninstalled the Adjust Purchase Verification SDK, you must remove all Purchase Verification code from your project.

### [3. Migrate to SDK v5 purchase verification](migrate-to-sdk-v5-pv)

Once you've removed the existing purchase verification code, you can replace it with SDK v5's built-in purchase verification methods. There are two ways to verify purchases with the Adjust SDK:

1. Create an `AdjustEvent` object that represents your purchase and add the following properties:
   -  `productId` (`String`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   -  `purchaseToken` (`String`): The purchase token generated for your successfully completed in-app purchase.
2. Create an `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` object with your product ID and purchase token.

<Callout type="tip">

If you use revenue events to measure your purchases in Adjust, you should use the `AdjustEvent` class. If you only want to verify a purchase but don't want to associate it with an event, use the `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` class.

#### [Record event and verify purchase](record-event-and-verify-purchase)

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   -  `productId` (`String`): The ID of the product that has been purchased.
   -  `purchaseToken` (`String`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `event` (`AdjustEvent`): Your instantiated event object.
   -  `callback` (`OnPurchaseVerificationFinishedListener`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase(adjustEvent, new OnPurchaseVerificationFinishedListener() {
    @Override

       Log.d("Verification status: ", result.verificationStatus);
       Log.d("Code: ", result.code);
       Log.d("Message: ", result.message);
    }
});
```

#### [Only verify purchase](only-verify-purchase)

To send a standalone purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `AdjustPlayStorePurchase` with the following arguments:
   -  `productId` (`String`): The ID of the product that has been purchased.
   -  `purchaseToken` (`String`): The purchase token associated with the purchase.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `purchase` (`AdjustPlayStorePurchase`): Your instantiated purchase object.
   -  `callback` (`OnPurchaseVerificationFinishedListener`): A delegate callback function that receives an `AdjustPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.
