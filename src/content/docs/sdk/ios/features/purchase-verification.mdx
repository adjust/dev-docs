<SdkVersion version="v5">

If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you can use the Adjust SDK to request purchase verification.

<Callout type="important">

To use Purchase verification, you first need to set up your app for purchase verification in the Adjust suite. See [Set up purchase verification for your app](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/set-up-purchase-verification-for-your-app) for instructions.

</Callout>

There are two ways to verify purchases with the Adjust SDK:

1. Create an `ADJEvent` object that represents your purchase and add the following properties:
   -  `productId` (`NSString`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   -  `transactionId` (`NSString`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
   -  `receipt` (`NSData`): The in-app purchase receipt.
2. Create an `ADJAppStorePurchase` object with your product ID, transaction ID, and receipt.

<Callout type="tip">

If you use revenue events to measure your purchases in Adjust, you should use the `ADJEvent` class. If you only want to verify a purchase but don't want to associate it with an event, use the `ADJAppStorePurchase` class.

</Callout>

When you send purchase information with the Adjust SDK, Adjust does the following:

1. Sends the information to the App Store and waits for a status response.
2. Forwards the status response to the Adjust SDK.

You can access the purchase verification status by using a callback. Results are returned as `ADJPurchaseVerificationResult` objects containing the following properties:

-  `verificationStatus` (`NSString`): The status of the purchase.
-  `code` (`int`): The status code of the purchase.
-  `message` (`NSString`): Any message returned by the App Store.

## [Record event and verify purchase](record-event-and-verify-purchase)

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```objc
- (void)verifyAndTrackAppStorePurchase:(nonnull ADJEvent *)event
                 withCompletionHandler:(nonnull ADJVerificationResultBlock)completion;
```

</CodeBlock>

To send a revenue event for verification and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `ADJEvent` object with the your event token and set the following parameters:
   -  `productId` (`NSString`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   -  `transactionId` (`NSString`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
   -  `receipt` (`NSData`): The in-app purchase receipt.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `event` (`ADJEvent`): Your instantiated event object.
   -  `callback` (`ADJVerificationResultBlock`): A delegate callback function that receives an `ADJPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

To send a standalone purchase and listen for the purchase verification status, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an `ADJAppStorePurchase` with the following arguments:
   -  `productId` (`NSString`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased.
   -  `transactionId` (`NSString`): The ID of the transaction you want to verify.
   -  `receipt` (`NSData`): The in-app purchase receipt.
2. Call the `Adjust.verifyAppStorePurchase` method with the following arguments:
   -  `purchase` (`ADJAppStorePurchase`): Your instantiated purchase object.
   -  `callback` (`ADJVerificationResultBlock`): A delegate callback function that receives an `ADJPurchaseVerificationResult` object as an argument.

In this example, the purchase verification response is output to the logging daemon.

<SdkVersion version="v4">

If you've enabled [purchase verification](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/purchase-verification), you must send additional information with your purchase events to verify them. When Adjust's servers receive this information in an `ADJEvent` object, they forward it to Apple to verify the purchase.

To verify a purchase, instantiate an `ADJEvent` object with your event token and set the following properties:

-  `transactionId` (`NSString`): The [`transactionIdentifier` value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransaction/1411288-transactionidentifier) of the successfully completed purchase
-  `productId` (`NSString`): The product identifier of the item that was successfully purchased
-  `receipt` (`NSData`): The [signed receipt](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle/1407276-appstorereceipturl) containing the information about the successfully completed purchase

<Callout type="seealso">

See [Send event information](/en/sdk/ios/features/events) for more information on the `ADJEvent` class.
