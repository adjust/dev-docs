The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.

## ID For Advertisers

The <Abbr>IDFA (ID for Advertisers)</Abbr> is a device-specific identifier for Apple devices. Call the <Tooltip>`idfa` method || <IdfaSig /></Tooltip> to return this ID as a **string**.

<Idfa />

## Adjust device identifier

Adjust generates a unique <Abbr>ADID (Adjust Device ID)</Abbr> for each device. Call the <Tooltip>`adid` method || <AdidSig /></Tooltip> to return this ID as a **string**.

<Adid />
