The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.

## ID For Advertisers

The IDFA (ID for Advertisers) is a device-specific identifier for Apple devices. Call the `idfa` method to return this ID as a **string**.

<Idfa />

## Adjust device identifier

Adjust generates a unique ADID (Adjust Device ID) for each device. Call the `adid` method to return this ID as a **string**.

<Adid />
