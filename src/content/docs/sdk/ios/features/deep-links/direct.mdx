<SdkVersion version="v5">

You can configure deep linking in your app after you have set it up in the Adjust dashboard. **Direct deep linking** occurs when a user has your app installed on their device. The link takes the user to a specific page within your app.

To enable deep linking, you need to do the following:

-  [ ] Enable Associated Domains for your app
-  [ ] Configure your deep links in Xcode

## Enable Associated Domains {#enable-associated-domains}

To get started, you need to enable Associated Domains in your Apple Developer account. This allows you to set universal link domains in your app. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account/).
2. Select **Certificates, IDs & Profiles** in the left-hand menu.
3. Select **Identifiers** in the left-hand menu.
4. Find your app and select it to open the edit page.
5. Ensure that **Associated Domains** is checked under **Capabilities**.
6. Select **Save** to save your changes.

## Configure deep links in Xcode {#configure-deep-links-in-xcode}

Follow these steps to add your deep link configuration to your Xcode project.

### Adjust universal links domain {#adjust-universal-links-domain}

1. Open your app project in Xcode.
2. Select your project from the left-hand menu.
3. Select your app under **Targets**.
4. Select **Signing & Capabilities** from the top menu.
5. Ensure that **All** is selected in the submenu below.
6. Select the Add option (**+**) to add a capability.
7. Select **Associated Domains**.
8. Enter the Adjust Universal Link domain with the prefix `applinks:`
   -  Here is an example using the `example.adj.st` domain: `applinks:example.adj.st`.

### Custom URL scheme {#custom-url-scheme}

<Callout type="tip">

Check with your marketing team to see if a custom URL scheme is needed for the app and discuss what the scheme name should be. If your app targets Android devices as well, use the same scheme name for each platform.

</Callout>

1. Open your app project in Xcode.
2. Select your project from the left-hand menu.
3. Select your app under **Targets**.
4. Select **Info** from the top menu.
5. Expand the **URL Types** section.
6. Select the Add option (**+**) to add a URL type.
7. Fill in the following information to create a URL scheme:
   -  **Identifier**: `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)`
   -  **URL Schemes**: Your custom URL scheme. This must be
      unique. Don't use protected schemes such as `http`, `https`, or `mailto`.
   -  **Role**: Editor

This scheme will work for your production **and** debug builds.

## Modify your iOS app {#modify-your-ios-app}

You need to update your iOS app to set up different deep linking scenarios. How you update your app depends on whether your app uses [scenes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes).

### App doesn't use scenes {#app-doesn-t-use-scenes}

If your app doesn't uses scenes, you need to update methods in your app delegate.

#### Universal links {#universal-links}

Update the `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)` method in your app delegate to call the following methods in the Adjust SDK:

-  `ADJLinkResolution.resolveLink`: Call this method only if your marketing team requires the use of Adjust's Link Resolution solution. If the deep link uses a domain that matches an element in the `resolveUrlSuffixArray`, then the method attempts to resolve the deep link, and returns the resolved link. If the deep link doesn't match an element in this array, then the method passes through the original deep link, so you can pass all deep links to this method.
-  `Adjust.processDeeplink` - Call this method to send deep links to Adjust's servers to record information. You can pass both Adjust and non-Adjust deep links to this method. Adjust's servers will ignore any deep links that don’t have Adjust parameters.

When a user clicks on your universal link, iOS opens your app and delivers the deep link to `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)`. This occurs whether the user has closed your app or has it running in the background.

#### Custom URL scheme {#custom-url-scheme-1}

If your marketing team requires you to set up custom URL scheme deep links, update the `application(_:open:options:)` method in your app delegate to call the `Adjust.processDeeplink` method in the Adjust SDK. This method sends deep links to Adjust's servers to record them. You can pass both Adjust and non-Adjust deep links to this method. Adjust's servers ignore any deep links that don’t have Adjust parameters.

When a user clicks on your custom URL scheme deep link, iOS opens your app and delivers the deep link to `application(_:open:options:)`. This occurs whether the user has closed your app or has it running in the background.

### App uses scenes {#app-uses-scenes}

If your app uses scenes, you need to update methods in your scene delegate.

#### Universal links {#universal-links-1}

1. Update the `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` method in your scene delegate. When a user clicks on your universal links and the user has your app closed, iOS opens your app and delivers the deep link to this method.
2. Update the `scene(_:continue:)` method in your scene delegate. When a user clicks on your universal links, and the user has your app running in the background, iOS opens your app and delivers the deep link to this method.

The above methods call the following methods in the Adjust SDK:

-  `ADJLinkResolution.resolveLink`: Call this method only if your marketing team requires the use of Adjust's Link Resolution solution. If the deep link uses a domain that matches an element in the `resolveUrlSuffixArray`, then the method attempts to resolve the deep link, and returns the resolved link. If the deep link doesn't match an element in this array, then the method passes through the original deep link, so you can pass all deep links to this method.

2. Update the `scene(_:openURLContexts:)` method in your scene delegate. When a user clicks on your custom URL scheme deep link, and the user has your app running in the background, iOS opens your app and delivers the deep link to this method.

These methods call the `Adjust.appWillOpen` method in the Adjust SDK. This method sends deep links to Adjust's servers to recordd them. You can pass both Adjust and non-Adjust deep links to this method. Adjust's servers ignore any deep links that don’t have Adjust parameters.

#### Custom URL scheme {#custom-url-scheme-2}

1. Update the `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` method in your scene delegate. When a user clicks on your custom URL scheme deep link and the user has your app closed, iOS opens your app and delivers the deep link to this method.
2. Update the `scene(_:openURLContexts:)` method in your scene delegate. When a user clicks on your custom URL scheme deep link, and the user has your app running in the background, iOS opens your app and delivers the deep link to this method.

These methods call the `Adjust.appWillOpen` method in the Adjust SDK. This method sends deep links to Adjust's servers to recordd them. You can pass both Adjust and non-Adjust deep links to this method. Adjust's servers ignore any deep links that don’t have Adjust parameters.
