An external device identifier is a custom value that you can assign to a device or user. They help you recognize users across sessions and platforms. They can also help you deduplicate installs by user so that a user isn't counted as duplicate new installs. Contact your Adjust representative to get started with external device IDs.

You can use an external device ID as a custom identifier for a device. This helps you keep continuity with your other systems.

You can set an external device ID by specifying an `externalDeviceId` argument in the `initSdk` method. The external device ID is case-sensitive. If you have imported external device IDs, make sure the value you pass matches the imported value.

```js
Adjust.initSdk({
   appToken: 'YOUR_APP_TOKEN',
   environment: 'sandbox',
   externalDeviceId: 'YOUR_EXTERNAL_DEVICE_ID'
});
```

You can import existing external device IDs into Adjust. This ensures that the Adjust servers match future data to your existing device records. Contact your Adjust representative for more information.
