The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.

## Web UUID

```js title="Method signature"
function getWebUUID(): string | undefined;
```

To identify web users in Adjust, Web SDK generates a unique `web_uuid` when it tracks the first session. The ID is created per subdomain and per browser. The identifier follows the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) format.

Call the `getWebUUID` method to return this information as a `string`.

```js
const webUUID = Adjust.getWebUUID();
```
