The Adjust SDK contains helper methods that return device information. Use these methods to add details to your callbacks and improve your reporting.

## Web ID

To identify web users in Adjust, Web SDK generates a unique `web_uuid` when it tracks the first session. The ID is created per subdomain and per browser. The identifier follows the <Abbr>UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)</Abbr> format.

Call the `getWebUUID` method to return this information as a **string**.

<GetWebUUID />
