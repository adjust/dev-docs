The Adjust SDK contains features that you can use to handle user privacy in your app.

## Send right to be forgotten request

```js title="Method signature"
function gdprForgetMe(): void;
```

Article 17 of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants users the right to be forgotten. When Adjust's servers receive a Right to be Forgotten (RTBF) request, Adjust erases the user's data. The SDK also stops sending requests from the device for the app in question.

You can send the user's RTBF request to Adjust by calling the `gdprForgetMe` method.

```js
Adjust.gdprForgetMe();
```

## Disable third-party sharing

```js title="Method signature"
function disableThirdPartySharing(): void;
```

To disable third-party sharing for all users, call the `disableThirdPartySharing` method. When Adjust's servers receive this information, Adjust stops sharing the user's data with third parties. The Adjust SDK continues to work as expected.

```js
Adjust.disableThirdPartySharing();
```

## Data residency

```js title="Property declaration"
dataResidency: "EU" | "TR" | "US";
```

The data residency feature allows you to choose the country in which Adjust stores your data. This is useful if you're operating in a country with strict privacy requirements. When you set up data residency, Adjust stores your data in a data center located in the region your have chosen.

To set your country of data residency, pass the region code of your preferred country code in the `dataResidency` property of the `initSdk` method.

<Table>

| Region                   | Code |
| ------------------------ | ---- |
| European Union           | `EU` |
| Turkey                   | `TR` |
| United States of America | `US` |

</Table>

```js {5}
Adjust.initSdk({
   appToken: "YOUR_APP_TOKEN",
   environment: "production",
   logLevel: "verbose",
   dataResidency: "EU",
});
```

## URL strategy

```js title="Property declaration"
urlStrategy: "india" | "china";
```

You can set a URL strategy to prioritize regional endpoints for sending data from the Adjust SDK. To do this, pass the region of your preferred country code in the `urlStrategy` property of the `initSdk` method.

<Table>

| Region | Code    |
| ------ | ------- |
| China  | `china` |
| India  | `india` |

</Table>

```js {5}
Adjust.initSdk({
   appToken: "YOUR_APP_TOKEN",
   environment: "production",
   logLevel: "verbose",
   urlStrategy: "china",
});
```

## Set custom endpoint

```js title="Property declaration"
customUrl: string;
```

By default, the Adjust SDK sends all data to Adjust's endpoints. If you want to specify a custom endpoint, pass your endpoint in the `customUrl` property of the `initSdk` method.

```js {4}
Adjust.initSdk({
   appToken: "YOUR_APP_TOKEN",
   environment: "sandbox",
   customUrl: "https://my-custom-url.com/",
});
```
