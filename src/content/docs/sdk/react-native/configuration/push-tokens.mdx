Push tokens are used for [Audience Builder](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/audience-builder) and client callbacks. They're also required for [Uninstall and reinstall tracking](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/uninstalls-reinstalls).

Your config object contains a string `pushToken` property that you can use to store your push token. You can update this property at any time by calling the <Tooltip>`setPushToken` method || <SetPushTokenSig /></Tooltip> and passing your token as an argument.

<SetPushToken />

## Example

This example shows how to set a new push token with the value _`HrFmrcq96tj723aWFfrw`_ to track your app's retention rates. You can update this value at any time by passing a new token to the <Tooltip>`setPushToken` method || <SetPushTokenSig /></Tooltip> as an argument:

```jsx '"HrFmrcq96tj723aWFfrw"'
Adjust.setPushToken("HrFmrcq96tj723aWFfrw");
```
