When a user interacts with an Adjust link, their attribution information updates. This can happen if the user interacts with a [deep link](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/deep-links). Information about a user's attribution is represented in the `AdjustAttribution` class.

## AdjustAttribution class properties {#adjustattribution-class-properties}

The `AdjustAttribution` class contains details about the current attribution status of the device. Any values that aren't populated for the user are returned as a `null` value.

<Callout type="note">

The following values can only be accessed if the [`needsCost` property on your `AdjustConfig` instance](/en/sdk/react-native/configuration#enable-cost-data-sending) is `true`:

-  `costType`
-  `costAmount`
-  `costCurrency`

</Callout>

## Trigger a function when attribution changes {#trigger-a-function-when-attribution-changes}

<CodeBlock title="Property declaration">

```ts
public setAttributionCallback(
      callback: (attribution: AdjustAttribution) => void
    ): void
```

</CodeBlock>

The SDK can listen for attribution changes and call a function when it detects an update. To configure your callback function, call the `setAttributionCallbackListener` method with your function as an argument.

<Callout type="important">

You must call the `setAttributionCallbackListener` method **before** initializing the Adjust SDK in your app.

</Callout>

<CodeBlock highlight="{range: 3-18}">

```jsx
const adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);

adjustConfig.setAttributionCallbackListener(function (attribution) {
   // Printing all attribution properties.
   console.log("Attribution changed!");
   console.log(attribution.trackerToken);
   console.log(attribution.trackerName);
   console.log(attribution.network);
   console.log(attribution.campaign);
   console.log(attribution.adgroup);
   console.log(attribution.creative);
   console.log(attribution.clickLabel);
   console.log(attribution.adid);
   console.log(attribution.costType);
   console.log(attribution.costAmount);
   console.log(attribution.costCurrency);
   console.log(attribution.fbInstallReferrer);
});

Adjust.create(adjustConfig);
```

</CodeBlock>

## Get current attribution information {#get-current-attribution-information}

<CodeBlock title="Method signature">

```ts
getAttribution: (callback: (attribution: AdjustAttribution) => void) => void
```

</CodeBlock>

When a user installs your app, Adjust attributes the install to a campaign. The Adjust SDK gives you access to campaign attribution details for your install. To return this information, call the `getAttribution` method to return the attribution information as an `AdjustAttribution` object.

```jsx
Adjust.getAttribution((attribution) => {
   console.log("Tracker token = " + attribution.trackerToken);
   console.log("Tracker name = " + attribution.trackerName);
   console.log("Network = " + attribution.network);
   console.log("Campaign = " + attribution.campaign);
   console.log("Adgroup = " + attribution.adgroup);
   console.log("Creative = " + attribution.creative);
   console.log("Click label = " + attribution.clickLabel);
   console.log("Adid = " + attribution.adid);
});
```
