You can use the Adjust SDK to record information about subscription purchases in your app.

<Callout type="important">

Make sure to set your SDK environment to **Production** after you finish testing. This ensures your app works in production mode.

</Callout>

Use these tools to test the SDK:

- The Adjust testing console, available in [AppView](https://help.adjust.com/ko/article/testing-console).
- The [Adjust Device API](/ko/api/device-api/inspect).
- Your IDE's log output.

To test that this is working:

1. Follow the integration guide for your platform to integrate the Adjust SDK.
2. Set the environment to **sandbox** . This ensures that your app only sends information to the testing console.
3. Set your log level to **verbose** to capture all logging information from your app.
4. Set up a test device or an emulated device and find the device's advertising ID. You can install the [Adjust Insights app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adjust-insights/id1125517808) to find this information.
5. If you've previously used the device for testing:

   1. Delete your app from the test device.
   2. Clear the device's advertising ID from the testing console. Follow the instructions for the [Testing console in AppView](https://help.adjust.com/ko/article/testing-console#forget-device).
   3. Alternatively, call the [forget device endpoint](/ko/api/device-api/forget/) to remove existing information about the device.

6. Download and open the test version of your app that contains the Adjust SDK.
7. Trigger a test purchase.
8. Open the testing console and check the device's advertising ID status.

If the subscription is recorded successfully, the following fields are populated in the console output:

- **Last Subscription Event Type**
- [**Last Subscription Event Subtype**](https://help.adjust.com/ko/article/manage-subscription-data#subscription-event-subtypes)
- **Last Subscription Event Timestamp**
- **Product ID**
