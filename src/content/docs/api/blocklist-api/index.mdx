"Blacklist" and "whitelist" have been renamed to "blocklist" and "allowlist" respectively. Currently this change applies to the UI and documentation. While Adjust works towards updating the codebase, you'll still see the term "blacklist" in the API endpoints.

</Callout>

Use the Adjust Blocklist API to block traffic from fraudulent or outdated links. Blocklisted links display a **BLOCKLISTED** label in the dashboard.

You can blocklist links for Dynamic and Module partners. You can't blocklist SAN partner links. If you want to block traffic from a SAN partner URL, you need to delete the SAN partner.

See [Self-attributing network setup
](https://help.adjust.com/en/suite/article/self-attributing-network-san-setup) for a list of SAN partners.

## [1. Authenticate your calls](1-authenticate-your-calls)

To use the Adjust Blocklist API, you first need to get your Adjust API token. Follow the instructions in the Authentication article to find out how to use this token with the API.

## [2. Blocklist a link](2-blocklist-a-link)

[Blocklist a link](/en/api/blocklist-api/blocklist) to block the following information:

-  Engagements
   -  Clicks
   -  Impressions
-  Callbacks to partners and networks
   -  Module callbacks
   -  Dynamic callbacks

Any existing attributions associated with the link remain associated. Data from attributed users associates to the link until the user is reattributed to a different link.

## [3. Unblocklist a link](3-unblocklist-a-link)

If you want to reactivate a link URL, you can [unblocklist it](/en/api/blocklist-api/unblocklist). Once you unblocklist the link, Adjust resumes measuring engagement and callbacks.

<Callout type="note">

Unblocklisting a link enables it immediately. Attribution data associated to the link while it was blocklisted isn't considered. Only engagements received when the link is enabled are considered in your attribution funnel.

</Callout>

## [4. View link status](4-view-link-status)

You can check which links are blocklisted in [Campaign Lab](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/campaign-setup). To do this:

1. Navigate to Campaign Lab.
2. Select a partner to display a list of associated links.

Links on the blocklist display as **Blocklisted**.

You can't edit blocklisted links, but you can hide them in Campaign Lab if you don't want to see them. For more on hiding links, see [hidden links in Campaign Lab](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/manage-ad-network-setup#hidden-links).
