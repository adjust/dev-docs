Use the Partner ad spend API to send ad spend information associated with a campaign to Adjust. Adjust accepts ad spend data for an engagement **up to seven days** after the engagement occurs.

## [Set up a Cost ID](cost-id)

**Cost ID**

: A unique ad spend engagement identifier value **between 12 and 256 characters** in length.

You MUST include a unique **Cost ID** associated with a campaign with each call you make to the Partner ad spend API. Adjust uses the Cost ID to match ad spend data you send with a click or impression.

The Cost ID MUST be unique. Adjust RECOMMENDS using a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) or prefixing your ID with your company's name. For example: `network_name_848dsf4939fgwjn028erg4`

You may use your pre-existing `click_id` or `impression_id`. If you don't generate your own click or impression IDs, you can combine two or more placeholders to form it. For example for Cost Per Impression (CPI), you could combine the userâ€™s IDFA (ID For Advertisers) and the app ID.

### [Measure CPM with Adjust](measure-cpm-with-adjust)

To send CPM (Cost Per Mille) data to Adjust, add a `cost_id` parameter to your impression URL with the same value as the the `cost_id` you send in your Partner ad spend API calls. You MUST send CPM with **each** impression when measuring CPM.

## [Send ad spend data](send-ad-spend-data)

<CodeBlock title="Endpoint" highlight="/cost">

## [Test your integration](test-your-integration)

Once you've configured your server to send the required parameters, reach out to wizards@adjust.com. Adjust provides you with a series of tests. You can check for discrepancies in the different ad spend types and address any issues before setting the integration live. Adjust also conducts tests on the Adjust API to ensure the API integration functions as expected.

Once testing is complete, Adjust adds you to a [list of integrated ad spend partners](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/ad-spend-api-integrations#supported-partners).
