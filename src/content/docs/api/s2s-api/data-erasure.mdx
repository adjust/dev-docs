The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar privacy laws worldwide (CCPA, LGPD, etc.) grant data subjects comprehensive rights when it comes to the processing of their personal data. These rights include, among others, the right to erasure (see [Art. 17 GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/article-17-right-to-be-forgotten/))([1](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/gdpr#ref-1)). As a data processor, Adjust is obliged to support you (the data controller) in the processing of such requests from your (app) users.

You can send the user's erasure request to Adjust using the `gdpr_forget_device` endpoint. Once Adjust has been notified:

-  Adjust will permanently delete all the user’s historical personal data from internal system and database.
-  Adjust will no longer receive data from this user/device via the Adjust SDK.([2](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/gdpr#ref-2))

Configure your server to send requests to this API endpoint when users send erasure requests. See the [Right to erasure article](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/gdpr) for more information about erasure requests.

<Callout type="important">

This action is **permanent**. Adjust can't reinstate data previously associated with a device or receive future requests from the device once a erasure request is sent.

## [Send an erasure request](send-an-erasure-request)

Send a POST request including your app token and device ID to remove all data associated with the device.

<Callout type="note">

Erasure requests only apply to the app you specify in your call. Device data for other apps aren't affected.
