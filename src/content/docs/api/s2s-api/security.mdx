With Adjust's S2S Security feature, you can guarantee the security of your S2S events and protect against spoofed requests. After you set up S2S authentication each incoming request must carry a token generated in your Adjust dashboard. Requests that don't carry a valid token are rejected by Adjust's servers.

## Before you begin

Here's what you need to know before getting started.

<Callout type="warning">

S2S Security isn't compatible with Google Tag Manager event measurement. Using Adjust's S2S authentication tokens in your Google Tag Manager configuration means that incoming Google Tag events are rejected.

</Callout>

### Requirements

-  [Admin permissions](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/permission-levels)

## Create an S2S token

<Callout type="important">

You must configure at least one token to enable S2S authentication.

</Callout>

1. Under **AppView**, select **All apps**.
2. Select your app.
3. Select the **Protection** tab.
4. Under the **S2S Security** section, select **Open S2S Security**.
5. Select **Add token**.
6. Enter a token name, and select **Add token**.
7. Select the copy icon to copy the token, and send it to your developer to add to your S2S event requests.
8. Ask your developer to run tests to confirm the integration.

At this point, S2S authentication isn't active and requests carrying invalid tokens are still accepted. Speak to your dedicated Technical Account Manager or contact support@adjust.com to validate the setup before activating S2S authentication.

## Token scopes

When S2S authentication is enabled, you must specify **scopes** for each token. Scopes define what actions you can take using a token. The following scopes are available:

-  **Events**: grants the ability to send event data.
-  **Sessions**: grants the ability to send session data.
-  **Ad revenue**: grants the ability to send ad revenue data.

### Create a scoped token

To create a new scoped token:

1. Under **AppView**, select **All apps**.
2. Select your app.
3. Select the **Protection** tab.
4. Under the **S2S Security** section, select **Open S2S Security**.

5. Select **Add token**. A modal appears.
6. In the modal that appears, enter a token **Token name**.

7. Select the scope(s) you want to assign to the token from the **Scope** dropdown. You can select multiple scopes for each token.

8. Select **Add token** to save your token.
9. Select **Copy token and close** to copy the token. Send it to your developer to add to your S2S event requests.

The scopes of each token are visible in the token list.

## Activate S2S authentication

<Callout type="important">

Activate S2S authentication only after your developer has tested token implementation, and your Technical Account Manager or support@adjust.com has validated your setup.

</Callout>

To activate S2S authentication, follow these steps.

1. Under **AppView**, select **All apps**.
2. Select your app.
3. Select the **Protection** tab.
4. Under the **S2S Security** section, select **Open S2S Security**.
5. Ensure you have at least one token configured.
6. Switch the toggle **ON**. A warning message appears to inform you that only requests sent with configured tokens will work.
7. Select **Turn on** to proceed.

Now, all incoming S2S requests are required to carry an active authentication token. If you previously configured a token without any scopes, these will continue to work for **all** endpoints. For added security, you should use scoped tokens.

## Example authenticated request

```console
curl -v -X \
POST -H \
"Authorization: Bearer v8s5opi0zs45607l8h8c48wak2vxb5oe" \
"https://s2s.adjust.com/event?s2s=1&app_token=abc123kuvada7&event_token=xyzklm&gps_adid=11110111-2345-6789-1122-000000005678"
```

```text
> POST /event?s2s=1&app_token=abc123kuvada7&event_token=xyzklm&gps_adid=11110111-2345-6789-1122-000000005678 HTTP/1.1
> Host: s2s.adjust.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
> Accept: */*
> Authorization: Bearer v8s5opi0zs45607l8h8c48wak2vxb5oe
```

Requests return one of the responses below.

</Table>

## Manage your tokens

To add multiple auth tokens, follow the same [setup steps listed above](#activate-s2s-authentication).

<Callout type="note">

Always test your tokens after implementation. When S2S authentication is active, requests with new tokens that aren't correctly implemented are rejected.

</Callout>

If you're no longer using a token, you can **deactivate** it:

1. Under **AppView**, select **My apps**.
2. Select your app.
3. Select the **Protection** tab.
4. Under the **S2S Security** section, select **Open S2S Security**.
5. Find your token and slide the toggle to the **off** position.

<Callout type="important">

If you deactivate all your tokens, Adjust automatically deactivates S2S authentication to ensure you don't reject all S2S traffic.

</Callout>

You can reactivate inactive tokens at any time sliding the toggle to the **on** position, or hide inactive tokens by turning the **Show inactive tokens** toggle off.

To deactivate S2S authentication, disable the toggle labeled **S2S authentication is ON: youâ€™re protected against fraud.**. A warning modal appears. Select **Turn off** to deactivate S2S authentiaction.
