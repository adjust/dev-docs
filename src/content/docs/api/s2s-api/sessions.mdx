Sessions are the base of all attribution and measurement in Adjust. They trigger when a user resumes using an app from the background or when they open the app. Use the S2S Session API to record each user session in your app.

<Callout type="important">

Adjust needs to turn this feature on for you. Contact your Technical Account Manager or support@adjust.com to proceed.

</Callout>

## [Before you begin](before-you-begin)

### [Authentication](authentication)

[Set up S2S Security](/en/api/s2s-api/security) to guarantee the security of your S2S sessions and protect against spoofed requests. This requires each incoming request to carry an authentication token generated in your Adjust dashboard. Requests that don't carry the token or that carry an incorrect token are rejected by Adjust's servers.

## [Record sessions](record-sessions)

Adjust groups sessions to save resources. This means there must be a gap of at least 30 minutes after a session, before the Adjust server accepts a new session as triggered.
