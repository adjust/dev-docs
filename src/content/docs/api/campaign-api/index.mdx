Use the Campaign API to get link, sublink, and partner information. Create new links and update existing links with new partner information.

## [How it works](how-it-works)

1. **Authenticate your calls**

   To use the Campaign API endpoints, you first need to get your Adjust API token. Follow the instructions in the [Authentication article](/en/api/campaign-api/authentication) to find out how to use this token with the API.

2. **Fetch a list of network links associated with your app**

   Use the `trackers` endpoint to fetch details about any links associated with your app. You can fetch a list of [top-level links](/en/api/campaign-api/get-links) or a list of [sublinks](/en/api/campaign-api/get-sublinks).

3. **Create new network links**

   You can add new links to your app by sending a [POST request to the `trackers` endpoint](/en/api/campaign-api/create-link). This endpoint supports creating top-level links and sublinks.

4. **Fetch a list of partners**

   Use the [`partners` endpoint](/en/api/campaign-api/get-partners) to fetch a list of partners. You can use these when updating your links.

5. **Update your link with new partners**

   Send a [PATCH request to the `trackers` endpoint](/en/api/campaign-api/update-link) to update existing links with new partners and cost data information.
