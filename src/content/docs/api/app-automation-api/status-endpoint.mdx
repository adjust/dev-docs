Use the `/status` endpoint to check the status of your new app. This endpoint returns the status of the process that copies settings from your `_Template` app to your new app.

```http title="Endpoint" "/status" "{ticket_token}"
GET https://settings.adjust.com/api/status/{ticket_token}
```

## Fetch copy process

Use this endpoint to return the status of a settings copy process. You receive your `ticket_token` when you create your app using the [`/app` endpoint](/en/api/app-automation-api/app-endpoint).
