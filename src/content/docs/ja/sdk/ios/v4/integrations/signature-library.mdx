Adjust's SDK Signature library is designed to be a standalone plugin for the Adjust SDK. This means you don’t need to change any of your code or change how you use the Adjust SDK in your app. Once you install the plugin, all requests made by the Adjust SDK will continue to work as expected.

Before you begin \{\#before\-you\-begin\}
----------------------------------------------

To integrate the Adjust Signature library into your iOS app, ensure the following:

* The Adjust SDK version in use is **4\.35\.2 or greater** . This requirement applies even when the Adjust SDK is used indirectly.
* iOS or tvOS version **12 or greater** is supported.

<callout type="important"> 

Using external obfuscation tools with the Adjust SDK or Signature library can impact the functionality of the Signature library. If you're unsure about using an external tool, reach out to your Adjust representative or email [support@adjust.com](mailto:support@adjust.com) to check if functionality is impacted.
</Callout> 

### Migrating from Signature v1 or v2 library \{\#migrating\-from\-signature\-v1\-or\-v2\-library\}

If you previously used Signature v1 or Signature v2, you first need to remove the previous version before integrating the Signature library. To do this:

* If you previously integrated Signature v1, remove any code that calls to signature functions in your project.
* If you previously integrated Signature v2, remove the Signature v2 library from your project.

### Updating the Signature Library \{\#updating\-the\-signature\-library\}

To update the Adjust Signature library, replace the existing Signature library with a new version and rerun your tests. You don't need to make any immediate changes to your app logic or settings in Adjust. Remember to [deactivate your secret IDs if they meet the following criteria](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/sdk-signature#manage-your-secret-ids):

* They're no longer contributing to your install reporting.
* You've fully released a new version of your app \(across all app platforms and stores\).

Integrate the signature library \(SDK v4 only\) \{\#integrate\-the\-signature\-library\}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<callout type="note"> 

Adjust SDK v5 supports SDK signature verification natively. If you previously integrated the SDK signature library, you should uninstall it and remove all related code.
</Callout> 

Follow these steps to integrate the Signature library in your iOS project.

1. Download the [`AdjustSigSdk-iOS-tvOS-Dynamic.xcframework.zip` archive from GitHub](https://github.com/adjust/adjust_signature_sdk/releases/latest).
2. Unzip the archive and copy the `AdjustSigSdk.xcframework` into your project’s directory.
3. In Xcode, select your project in the **Project Navigator** .
4. Select your target on the left\-hand side.
5. Select the **General** tab and expand the **Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Content** group.
6. Select the **\+** button at the bottom of the group.

7. Select **Add Other \-\-> Add Files** and select the `AdjustSigSdk.xcframework` file from the project directory.

8. Select the **Embed & Sign** option for the `AdjustSigSdk.xcframework`.

That’s it\! The Signature library is now integrated into your project.

Test your app \{\#test\-your\-app\}
----------------------------------------

You can verify you have integrated the Signature library into your app using the [Adjust Testing Console](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/testing-console).
<callout type="important"> 

You must ensure that the Adjust SDK is running in **Sandbox mode** .
</Callout> 

To test your Signature library integration:

1. Fully delete your app from the test device to ensure the install information is sent.

2. Forget the device using the Testing Console to clear out all information relating to the device. You can also use the forget\_device endpoint by passing your app token and the advertising ID you obtained from the [Adjust Insights app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adjust-insights/id1125517808). You can use any of the following advertising IDs: `adid`, `idfa`, `idfv`, `imei`, `oaid`.

   The call looks like this:

   ```console
   $ curl -X POST 'https://app.adjust.com/forget_device?app_token={yourAppToken}&id={adid}'
   ```

3. Once you’ve cleared the device from the Testing Console, install the app on your test device and launch it to send install information to Adjust.

4. Input the test device’s advertising ID into the Testing Console to fetch the install event information. Check the following:

   1. The `SignatureVerificationResult` field should show a value of `Valid Signature`
   2. The `SignatureVersion` field should show a value of `3`

If these fields are present and contain the correct information, you have successfully integrated the Signature library. If the fields display any other values, review the integration steps again or contact [support@adjust.com](mailto:support@adjust.com) for further assistance.

That’s it\! You’ve successfully integrated the Signature library into your app. Once [two attribution windows have passed](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/attribution-windows), you can [enforce SDK signature validation](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/sdk-signature#enforce-signature-validation) to make sure that only signed requests are accepted by Adjust.

トラブルシューティング \{\#troubleshooting\}
------------------------------------

### Upload symbols failed

Xcode 16で構築されたアプリを検証または提出すると、シグネチャーライブラリに関連する`Upload symbols failed`警告が表示される場合があります。シンボルが欠落した状態は意図的なものであり、機能性には影響しないため、無視しても問題ありません。
