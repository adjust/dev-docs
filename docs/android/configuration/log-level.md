# Set log level

The Adjust SDK provides configurable log levels to return different amounts of information. The following log levels are available:

:::{include} /android/reference/AdjustConfig/setup.md
:start-after: logLevel table
:end-before: tableEnd
:::

You can set your log level by calling the [`setLogLevel` method](#android-setloglevel-invocation) on your `AdjustConfig` instance.

:::{include} /android/reference/AdjustConfig/setup.md
:start-after: setLogLevel snippet
:end-before: Snippet end
:::
