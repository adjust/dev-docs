# Set up push tokens

Push tokens are used for [Audience Builder](hc:/audience-builder) and client callbacks. They're also required for [Uninstall and reinstall tracking](hc:/uninstalls-reinstalls).

Your config object contains a string `pushToken` property that you can use to store your push token. You can update this property at any time by calling the [`setPushToken` method](#android-setpushtoken-invocation) and passing your token as an argument.

## Example

This example demonstrates how to set a new push token with the value _`HrFmrcq96tj723aWFfrw`_ to track your app's retention rates. You can update this value at any time by passing a new token to the `setPushToken` method as an argument:

:::{tab-set-code}

```kotlin
Adjust.setPushToken("HrFmrcq96tj723aWFfrw", getApplicationContext())
```

```java
Adjust.setPushToken("HrFmrcq96tj723aWFfrw", getApplicationContext());
```

```javascript
Adjust.setPushToken('HrFmrcq96tj723aWFfrw')
```
