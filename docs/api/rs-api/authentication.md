# Report Service API authentication

You need a [bearer token](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication) to use the Report Service API. You can get this token in the Adjust dashboard by following the steps in this article.

## Before you begin

Users need [Admin, Editor, Reader, or Custom permissions](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/users#dashboard-permission-levels) to use an authorization token.

:::{note}
Your bearer token has the same permissions as your Adjust user account.

## Find your Adjust API token

Before you can start making API calls, you first need to find your Adjust API token. You can find your Adjust API token in your Adjust dashboard.

:::{important}
If you've configured SSO, your API tokens aren't available in the Adjust dashboard. Reach out to your Adjust representative or <support@adjust.com> for help with API tokens.

## Use your API token to authenticate calls

Once you've got your Adjust API token, you can use it to authenticate your {{ api_name }} calls. To do this, pass the token in the `Authorization` request header with your API calls.

The `Authorization` header uses the following format: {{ token_format }}

:::{parsed-literal}
$ curl https://api.adjust.com \
--header "{{ token_format }}"
