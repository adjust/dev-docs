# Ad spend API

The Ad spend API allows you to send the advertising cost information associated with a campaign. The API requires a cost id associated with the campaign to track.

To set up the Ad spend API successfully:

1. Set up your cost ID

   A Cost ID is a unique cost engagement identifier that Adjust uses to match cost data with a click or impression. See the [Set up cost ID article](cost-id.md) for information on how to set this up.

2. Set up the API integration

   Adjust accepts ad spend data through the /cost endpoint. Follow the instructions in the [Ad spend cost endpoint article](cost-endpoint.md) to set up your POST requests.

3. Test and finalize your integration with Adjust

   Once you have configured your servers to send the required parameters, reach out to <wizards@adjust.com>. Adjust can then begin the testing phase of the integration.

   Adjust provides you with a series of tests. You can check for discrepancies in the different cost types and spot any problems before the integration goes live. Adjust also conducts tests on the Adjust API to ensure the API integration is functioning as expected.

   After getting satisfactory results, Adjust adds you to a list of integrated ad spend partners as an official Adjust ad spend API partner.
