# Ad spend cost endpoint

Adjust's Ad Spend API provides accurate, transparent, and granular ad spend data. Adjust maps the cost information using a campaign's `cost_id` allowing Report Services to report the ad spend data back to the partner.

## Before you begin

To integrate with the Adjust ad spend API you must set up your servers to send a set of mandatory parameters to Adjust through an HTTP POST request to the designated endpoint.

:::{note}
Adjust accepts ad spend data for an engagement up to seven days after it happens. You can send data at any time during this window.
