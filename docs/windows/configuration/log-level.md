# Set log level

The Adjust SDK provides configurable log levels to return different amounts of information. The following log levels are available:

:::{include} /windows/reference/AdjustConfig/index.md
:start-after: logLevel table
:end-before: tableEnd
:::

You can set your log level by passing a `logLevel` value as the fourth positional argument of the `AdjustConfig` constructor.

:::{include} /windows/reference/AdjustConfig/index.md
:start-after: AdjustConfig snippet
:end-before: Snippet end
:::
